</div>

<p class='c006'>I wish to inform you, my dear Grandison,
what joy I felt when I returned
back again to a dearly loved mother.—But,
no;—you who love your parents
so tenderly, can easily imagine what I
cannot describe. How full of transport
was the moment, when, after a
year’s absence, I again embraced the dear
guardian of my youth. It was very
early in the morning when we entered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>the city; my mother, as we had not
had a fair wind, did not expect me, and
of course was in bed. My first eager
desire made me ascend the stairs; but as
I was hastening to her bedchamber I
recollected myself, and returned softly
back. It is still dark, thought I, shall
I disturb her repose, by my sudden appearance
at her bedside? Certainly not.
That would be mistaken love, mere
selfish affection. You will, I think, approve
of this prudence. Mean while I
was full of impatience: a thousand
times I wished her to wake, counted
the minutes, and listened continually.—At
length the moment arrived; my
heart beat quick; I almost flew up the
stairs; but again I stopped myself, and
resting on the last stair, I called out,
Here is your own William, dear mother,
may I come in? Was I not right, my
friend? for the sudden surprise of seeing
me, would have been too much for her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>spirits. Before I could well hear her
answer my patience was exhausted, and
I rushed in, and was at her bedside out
of breath; I could only say, My dear
mother. She pressed me to her bosom,
crying, My William, my son!—and we
both wept together: but they were delightful
tears: I never in my life experienced
so much heart-felt satisfaction.</p>

<p class='c007'>My sister Annette hurried on her
clothes as soon as she heard of my arrival,
and jumped about me half mad
with joy. She then ran for the doll,
which your sister Emilia sent her, and
made me observe how well she had preserved
it, and asked twenty questions in
a breath about this dear sister of your’s.
In the midst of them, the maid came to
tell her that her writing master waited
for her. I wish it was an hour earlier,
said she, with tears in her eyes; the moment
I see you I am forced to leave you;
another day, I should not mind writing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>four copies; but to-day I know not
how to go. Well, said my mother, observing
the tears she tried to hide, we
will desire the master, for this time, to
excuse you. Annette stood a moment
irresolute, then ran to her mother, and
said, it is from pure goodness that you
indulge me; but I know you would rather
I did not neglect my writing. Besides,
good Mr. M—— might be displeased
with me; it would not be right
to send such an old man away, I will
take my lesson. Would not Emilia do
so? and she skipped out of the room.</p>

<p class='c007'>I believe all children might be induced
to learn to read and write, if it was
made an amusement to them, without all
that gloom which generally accompanies
lessons. Children are very fond of imitating
men if they are allowed to follow
their own inclinations; yet are averse to
constraint: but you will think me too
serious. And I hasten to tell you what
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>I suffered when I left your dear family.
Your father’s kindness melted my very
soul, and even the expectation of seeing
the best of parents did not cheer me
when I first got into the packet-boat.
Farewell, sometime think of your affectionate
friend,</p>

<p class='c007'>P. S. The anniversary of Emilia’s
birth is now past without my being
able to celebrate it with you. With
what delight should I have gathered her
a nosegay of my best flowers, those hyacinths
and jonquils, which I raised
with so much care. But I was denied
that pleasure; my heart longs to tell her
all the good wishes you must now present
to her in my name. May she be
as happy as I wish her to be! I need
say no more.</p>

<div class='chapter'>

  <h2 class='c005'>LETTER II.<br> <span class='large'><span class='sc'>Charles</span> <i>to</i> <span class='sc'>William</span>.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Believe me, my dear William, I
very severely feel your absence: you will
be convinced of this when I tell you,
that this house, in which my best
friends, my parents reside, for the first
time in my life appeared dreary to me.
I ran from room to room, and could
scarcely believe that I am at home. I
went into the chamber where we used
to amuse ourselves; but vainly did I
endeavour to pursue the same employments;
I recollected, every instant, that
I was alone, and should have wept, only
I was ashamed of being so weak. My
greatest pleasure was in looking over
your drawings, and pointing out their
beauties to Emilia.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>I did not forget to present to her
your fine flowers, and she instantly put
them in water, that she might for a long
time enjoy their fragrance.</p>

<p class='c007'>I agree with you, William, that it is
very pleasant to be employed; but I am
afraid I should not always have thought
so if Dr. Bartlett had not taken so much
pains to make my employments amusements.
He has frequently reminded
me, that every duty soon becomes a
pleasure. How then can men neglect
their duties merely to be idle; the most
lazy burthens on society, he added,
would think it a severe punishment, if
during their whole life they were not
allowed to do any thing. How miserable
would they be, though surrounded
with all the conveniences, and even
superfluities of life. We should be
happier rowing in the gallies, than in
this settled listless state, which puts a
stop to all improvement, for improvement
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>is the main end of life, as it raises
us above the brutes, and enables us to
please God. I am sure he was right,
for when I have reluctantly begun to
work, I soon found it very pleasant, so
that I wished to go on, particularly
when we have been digging in our garden,
or using our turning tools. Nay,
it has been the same when I have been
reading or drawing.</p>

<p class='c007'>I must now have done, for it is nine
o’clock, the hour I attend Dr. Bartlett,
and he expects me to be very punctual,
if I have not a good reason to give
for my delay. Remember me to your
mother and sister, and write often to
yours,</p>

<div class='chapter'>

  <h2 class='c005'>LETTER III.<br> <span class='large'><span class='sc'>William</span> <i>to</i> <span class='sc'>Charles</span>.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>How agreeable, my dear Charles, has
Dr. Bartlett made my life; by teaching
me the habit of exercising my mind, he
has inspired me with curiosity to improve
myself in the sciences, and your
whole family have led me to love the
arts. I would draw, and learn music,
to be the companion of Emilia and
Charles. And pray thank your father
for the books and mathematical instruments
he gave me, and I hope, by my
future diligence, to prove that I am
grateful for the instructions I received at
your house.</p>

<p class='c007'>I daily find, that industry and perseverance
overcome many difficulties.
But I receive still more satisfaction from
my employments, when I perceive the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>pleasure my improvement affords my
mother.—I never saw her so happy since
my father’s death as she is at present.
Yesterday she came into my room, and
found me with my compasses in my
hand, and my books open before me.
Her eyes swam in tears, and she kissed me
affectionately, exclaiming, how thankful
ought I to be to heaven, for having
given me such a son to comfort my widowed
heart. Oh, Charles, what a satisfaction
I felt when I heard this said
by a mother I tenderly loved, and every
day more and more respect.—How valuable
were those lessons, added she,—which
you were favoured with; and what
a blessing for you has been the example
of your friend.—Very true, my dear
mother, answered I, but at the same
time I recollect, that you were my
first teacher; that you laid the groundwork;
had you not accustomed me to
diligence, and prepared me by your instructions,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>what should I have learnt
in one year even with the best masters?
You taught me to read the Dutch,
English, and French languages, and the
knowledge of them prejudiced my friends
in England in my favour.</p>

<p class='c007'>My mother, after having sat a few
moments, left me, but quickly returned,
with a cup of chocolate. A little refreshment,
William, said she, will
enable you to work with more pleasure,
and I know you are fond of chocolate.
Yes, answered I, my dear Madam, but I
receive more pleasure from this proof of
your goodness, than any refreshment
could ever afford me.</p>

<p class='c007'>My mother then asked if I had any
thing particular to do in the evening, if
not, she would give me a little commission.
You may be sure that I eagerly
told her I should be ready to do whatever
she desired who had a right to command.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>Well, said she, we shall see,
and left the room.</p>

<p class='c007'>After she left me I began to consider,
nay, to wonder, what it could be, for I
perceived a smile on her countenance
when she spoke of it. Suddenly it
darted into my head that this was the
first of April; you know it is the custom
to play tricks that day, and I
imagined I had discovered the secret,
and determined to be careful. We went
to dinner. I observed, that Annette
knew something of what was going
forwards, for I heard her say softly, No,
mother, I shall say nothing of it. I
went to my room, as usual, after dinner
to draw. Annette came soon after to
take a lesson, yet you will readily believe
I did not ask her any questions,
though I was really very curious. She
was cautious, but could not help laughing
several times. At last, an hour before
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>tea time, a violin was brought into
my chamber, and my mother soon afterwards
entered, followed by a genteel
looking man. I was astonished, and
silently bowed. She took the violin out
of the case and gave it me, saying, this
gentleman is a music master, who has
agreed to give you lessons, and I doubt
not you will be assiduous to profit by
his instructions. This is the commission
I mentioned this morning. Never,
no never, my dear Charles, was I more
agreeably surprised; I first took my mother,
and then my music master, by the
hand, and scarcely knew what I said
when I attempted to thank her.</p>

<p class='c007'>And what say you, Charles, am I not
very happy that my mother enables me to
improve myself in my favourite amusement?
If I ever visit dear England
again, I shall find no difficulty in playing
with you and Emilia. And what
adds to this obligation is the kindness
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>of my mother in procuring me an advantage
the narrowness of her circumstances
must render very inconvenient.</p>

<p class='c007'>I hastily ran down stairs after my
master left me, and could hardly refrain
boasting of her goodness before a lady
who came to drink tea with her. But
I was glad when she went away; then I
had an opportunity to give vent to my
grateful heart.</p>

<p class='c007'>How much have I injured you, my
dear mother, said I, by supposing you
were going to play me an April trick;
will you forgive me? Yes, certainly,
answered she, and I am glad you mentioned
it, that I may inform you from
what cause that foolish custom, of
making fools of each other, took its
rise. It was from the abuse and scoffing
which our Saviour suffered when he was
sent from Pilate to Herod, and back
again to Pilate, by those who had put on
him a scarlet robe by way of derision.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>Be careful, then, never to mock the
wretched, for then you again insult Jesus
Christ, and neglect to follow his
example, who was the pattern of all virtue.
Besides, many quarrels arise from
foolish frolicks, and we should never
enjoy a joke that gives a fellow-creature
pain.</p>

<p class='c007'>Two hours at least of the twenty-four
I shall now devote to music, though
my master is to come but twice a week;
yet I must constantly practise to prepare
myself for his lessons: I shall then rise
an hour sooner, for I have often heard
Dr. Bartlett say, that five or six hours
sleep is sufficient for a person in health.
Farewell, remember your friend</p>

</div>

<p class='c006'>Again do I see return that delightful
season in which every thing appears to
be revived, and we are once more at our
beloved Grandison Hall. You remember
well how pleasantly last summer
past away; the shady woods, these
charming walks, all brought you to my
remembrance, and particularly our little
garden.</p>

<p class='c007'>Edward has left us for some time;
his friends have procured a commission
for him; but I have another companion,
my cousin James, the eldest son of Lord
G—. He is a handsome lively youth,
and, my father says, has a good understanding,
yet I observe he does not find
that pleasure in the country that you
and I do. He is of a humourous turn,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>and sometimes treats the most serious
matters with too much levity. His disposition
would better agree with Edward’s
than mine, for he loves a frolic,
and calls mischief fun; however he has
a good heart, and possesses a winning
chearfulness of temper.</p>

<p class='c007'>We yesterday took a pleasant ride;
Emilia accompanied us: we went out
of the high road to a small village, and
stopt at a little farm house to purchase
some fruit. We had not been long in a
little room near the garden when we
heard a confused noise in the kitchen,
and I ran out to enquire the cause,
leaving my cousin with my sister. A
young man, well dressed, ran hastily
through the passage; he had been disputing
with the farmer, who now allowed
him to conceal himself in the
garden.</p>

<p class='c007'>He was scarcely out of sight, when a
respectable looking woman ran in,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>exclaiming, My son is here; I must, I
will see him! A mother who demanded
her son, and a son who avoids his mother,
thought I, this is something uncommon.
I felt extreme compassion,
which seemed to command me to assist
her: who, indeed, could see a distressed
mother without being moved? You
weep, said I; I cannot see a parent’s tear
without concern; has any misfortune
befallen your son? Yes, she replied, I
am almost without hope; perhaps it is
even now too late to save him from
ruin. I requested her to go into the
parlour to my sister, whilst I spoke to
the farmer, and sought for the son.
Emilia was surprised to see me enter
with a woman apparently distressed, but
with compassionate politeness she took
her hand, while I reached a chair. I
stopt a moment, afraid to ask her any
question, lest she should think me impertinent;
yet I wished her to speak that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>I might know what to say to her son.
She soon broke silence, and when her
tears allowed her to speak articulately,
said, “your kindness affects me, I am an
unfortunate widow, who formerly knew
better days, and never thought I should
be obliged to work for the necessaries of
life; but the sudden death of my husband,
a clergyman, has thrown me destitute
on the world. He left me a son,
who might have made my life comfortable,
if he had not been drawn aside from
the path of virtue by bad company.
Falling from one error to another, instead
of helping to soften my griefs, he
has made me feel that my afflictions indeed
are very heavy. My intreaties, my
threatenings, have all been fruitless; I
could not separate him from his thoughtless
companions, or induce him to follow
any useful employment, and”——here
her sobs prevented her from proceeding,
when she added, “I have just
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>heard, that he has entered himself as a
sailor, and is soon to go on board a man
of war which is now preparing for sea.
If he would exert himself he might
gain an honest livelihood, and be a comfort
to his unfortunate mother: it would
almost break my heart to part with him;
but though I could part with him for
his good, I cannot bear that he should
go with the companions who seduced
him from his duty, and first led him
into vice; should he become thoroughly
vicious, I should then lose him for ever,
and he would bring my grey hairs with
sorrow to the grave.”—I could not refrain
my tears, Emilia, and even James
wept.—No, Madam, said I, he shall not
leave you, I know where he is, and I
will hasten to him, to awaken him to
repentance, and I hastily left the room.</p>

<p class='c007'>I found the young man in a shed at
the bottom of the garden, and the following
conversation ensued.</p>

<p class='c007'>Yes, she has told me you would fly

    <div>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>It is noble in you not to wish to be a
burthen to your mother; a son of your
age should not expect a support, except
his parents are blest with affluence. But
I have been informed you are very
ingenious, and have received a good
education; heaven has not given you
these talents for no purpose.</p>

<p class='c007'>You will find no mother in a foreign

would you snatch from her her last support?
Surely you have no affection for

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>What, Sir, no affection for a mother

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>A strange proof you would give of it,
to leave her in solitary misery, when she
declares your absence would be her
death.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>I acknowledge it; but a weakness that
arises from an affection for you should
rather endear her to you. Excuse me,
Sir, but I think that children who have
such tender apprehensive parents, ought
to sacrifice a wavering uncertain prospect
of happiness rather than grieve
them. Nay, it would be for their own
advantage, if, as my tutor says, no happiness
is to be obtained by the violation
of duty. Should you return from sea
successful, and find her dead, repentance
would imbitter your whole future life,
for she assures me you have naturally an
affectionate good disposition. Continue
with her; when a mother in poverty
begins to labour under a weight of
years, it would be cowardly in a son to
desert her.</p>

<p class='c007'>There is nothing shameful in pursuing
any honest employment; but you
are not reduced to that situation. Any
one who has a tolerable understanding,
and has had a good education, may make
himself friends by his diligence:  in short,
there is no one who is virtuous and industrious
but may gain a subsistence,
and secure himself respect and esteem.
Come, consent; let me conduct you to
your mother; she has lived for you, you
in your turn ought to live for her. Our
parents are our best friends, whose loss
nothing can recompense; let those go
to sea who have no parents to weep for
them, who have no abilities to push
them forward in the employments
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>which require mental exertions; it becomes

<p class='c007'>That difficulty may easily be removed.
Come, throw yourself at your mother’s
feet, and give her cause to weep for joy.—At
last I persuaded him, and he
silently followed me, very much distressed.</p>

<p class='c007'>The mother no sooner saw us enter
the room, than she fell on his neck.
Oh! William, how tender is the affection
of a mother for her children. Bradley
seemed truly penitent and abashed;
but I shall not attempt to describe all
the affecting circumstances. Afterwards
he took me aside, and said, I am really
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>sorry to leave my mother, yet I must
fulfil my engagement, for I have spent
the bounty money; and the captain
would not be willing to part with a
stout hand supposing I could return it,
which is impossible. I bid him be easy,
and if he would promise to remain with
his mother, I did not doubt but that I
should prevail on my father to use his
interest with the captain. I said the
same to his mother, whose acknowledgment
made me blush, and, to avoid
them, I hastened our departure, and
thought the road very tedious till I arrived
at Grandison Hall, and had interested
my father in this poor woman’s
favour. I am to see Bradley next Friday:
I desired him to call on me; before
that time my father will take me to the
neighbouring sea-port, where the vessel
is fitting out for sea.—You shall hear
all about it: till then adieu.</p>

</div>

<p class='c006'>Well, my dear friend, my father has
exerted his interest, and the captain has
consented to release young Bradley from
his engagement. I returned the bounty
money; my father would have reimbursed
me, but I wished to do something
myself.</p>

<p class='c007'>I then visited the unhappy mother,
who joyfully received the news, and even
the son thanked me with tears in his eyes,
for he appears to have a good disposition,
though he has not sufficient firmness to
bear the laugh of his dissipated companions.
The poor woman still seems alive
to fear, but my father has promised to procure
him some employment; mean while
Dr. Bartlett will endeavour to prepare
him for it, by teaching him habits of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>regularity and order. That good man
thought of making him copy some of
his sermons, and making extracts from
books. This task young Bradley readily
performs in the steward’s room, and he
imagines that he is making himself useful,
when in reality this is only a scheme
of the benevolent Doctor’s to improve
him, and detach him from his former
idle companions. It already seems to
have had a good effect on him, and
my tutor says, he perceives a spark of
emulation blowing up in his mind, that
he hopes will strengthen his weak resolves,
and make him, in time, a virtuous
character.</p>

<p class='c007'>Our little garden is now in fine order
again, and I work at it with pleasure,
because I have got a new companion.
Can you guess who? no other than
your old friend Emilia. She has got a
dress proper to work in, and rises with
the lark to assist me; indeed she often
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>joins in the general concert, and sings as
chearfully as the birds that hop around
us. I asked her, yesterday, if she was
not afraid to dirty her hands. You
mean to laugh at me, said she, smiling,
I hope I shall never be a fine lady, or
forget that my hands were given me for
some other purpose than to keep them
soft and white. Believe me, brother, a
daisy I have raised by my own labour,
is a thousand times more acceptable to
me than the finest nosegay presented by
the gardener.</p>

<p class='c007'>But I must here close my letter, my

<p class='c006'>I am so happy, my dear William, I
can scarcely tell you what has made me
so. I am out of breath with joy; you
are to come, with your dear mother, to
live always in England. My kind parent
communicated the joyful tidings to
me, and added, that she had prevailed
on Mrs. D— to approve of her plan.
Never, never, was I more agreeably surprised;
but I will tell you all in a circumstantial
manner, when I have taken
breath, for my heart beats violently.—Well,
I am now more composed. After
breakfast, this morning, my mother desired
me to make an excuse to Dr. Bartlett,
and follow her into the garden,
when I joined her. I will give you our

<p class='c007'>You have taught me to be sincere. I
acknowledge I am disappointed, and
cannot in a moment forget it; I have
promised myself so much pleasure, and
William and I had formed so many
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>plans: I have so long thought of visiting
Holland, that I really long to see it.
But do not be angry, the pleasure of
obeying you and my father will outweigh
every other consideration. I shall
not have to part with you all, and I
have often thought with pain of the
time when I should leave you—when the
sea would divide us.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c002'>

<p class='c007'>The sea will not divide us; but you

necessary alterations there in your father’s

<p class='c007'>I expected an answer like this; but
the farm house you will inhabit, is situated
almost in a desart; you will have
few companions, and no amusements,
except the pleasure of relieving the
poor. We wish you to experience, that
the consciousness of being useful is the
truest pleasure; we can do without
company when we have peace in our

you will answer all my letters.—Yes, I
shall be happy—send me away as soon
as you please. Here I paused a little,
and was thoughtful, but I do not know
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>what I thought of, tears rushed involuntarily
into my eyes—my mother
observed it.</p>

<p class='c007'>Forgive my weakness, dear Madam,
I am ashamed of it. Let me soon set
out for the farm, I will not shed a tear
I promise you, and you shall see what
chearful letters I will write.</p>

<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div>LADY GRANDISON.</div>

<p class='c007'>You are the child of my heart; your
submission to your earthly parents proves
to me, that you will in future resign
yourself to the will of your heavenly
father, who never afflicts his children
but to improve them. But your trial at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>this time will not be so severe as you
imagine; I will fully explain myself; I
did not at first speak explicitly that I
might receive this proof of your submission
to our will. You are first to
accompany Dr. Bartlett on a visit to his
relations; and from thence go to the farm
for a short time, where you will find ample
employment, in visiting and assisting
the poor. She paused a moment for
my answer, and then went on; but
what think you, Charles, if Mrs. D—,
your friend William, and little Annette,
were to come and reside in England?
(I listened with all my ears, and she proceeded)
see here is a letter from Mrs.
D—, in which you will find, that the
proposal gave her great pleasure. We
are to prepare a house for her, and, as
you say you long to see Holland, it is
now our design to let you take a trip
there, to conduct your friend and his
mother to your native country, where it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>will be our study to make their situation
comfortable. What say you, Charles?</p>

<p class='c007'>I don’t know what I said, William, I
was almost wild with joy. And now I
have told you all, I will run again and
thank those dear parents; indeed, I feel
quite restless, I cannot sit still. In two

<p class='c006'>Could I believe that I should ever

of spending all my life with you
and your beloved family! No, I was
even afraid to hope for such happiness,
but now I number the days till I shall
see you: I have already put my books in
order; every thing is waiting for you. I
gave my mother your letter to read; she
bestowed the warmest praises on my dear
friend. He seems to have a just sense
of the duty due to parents, said she; a
good son always supposes that tender
parents have a sufficient reason for what
they do when they deprive him of any
little gratification; he then submits
without reluctance, or even enquiry,
certain that it is for his good. A child
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>that thus submits will, when a man, be

</div>

<p class='c007'>Such a chearful submission might
possibly require more resolution than
either you or I have; however it is

grateful for the kindnesses we have

<p class='c007'>This may be true, yet these considerations

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div>WILLIAM.</div>
  </div>

<p class='c007'>No, but yet I might say to myself, in
such a solitary place, I hope I am beloved
by my Creator, because I have done
my duty; then I should be much happier
than in the most magnificent palace,
upbraiding myself with having done
wrong, and having made God angry
by disobeying my parents.</p>

done right, my mother says, is a lasting

<p class='c007'>We then turned towards home; it
was a very fine evening, and I wanted
Frederick to observe the beautiful
country, and wondered he could pass
through such pleasing scenes with indifference.

</div>

<p class='c006'>This morning I set out, with Dr.
Bartlett, for the country where my father’s
estate is situated. I shall not have
many opportunities of sending letters
to you, yet I shall not neglect to
write.</p>

<p class='c007'>The account you gave me of Frederick
does not prejudice me in his favour.</p>

<p class='c007'>I was obliged to leave off suddenly
when I had written thus, for my cousin
G—, who accompanied us part of the
way, came to tell me that Dr. Bartlett
was waiting for me. We left him near
home, and for some time we missed his
sprightly sallies; but his taste for humour,
to which I think he is too much
addicted, often hurt me while we were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>on the road. The first instance, that I
now recollect, had a reference to Dr.
Bartlett.</p>

<p class='c007'>As the good old man was stepping
out of his carriage, his foot slipped, and
he fell with great force on the ground.
While I assisted him to rise, I turned
my eyes on my cousin, whom I saw endeavouring
in vain to smother a laugh;
at last he was obliged to run into the
house to give way to it, out of our hearing.
I felt that I was red with anger;
nothing displeases me more than to hear
any one laugh at an accident. I have
often heard people say they cannot help
it, but in my opinion it is a great proof
of insensibility. The most ludicrous
accident never makes me smile when
I see a fellow-creature, or even an
animal, in pain. I could not forbear
communicating my sentiments to my
cousin as soon as we were alone.</p>

<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>And yet when you saw him fall, not
knowing whether he had hurt himself,
you began to laugh, and flew into the
house without making any inquiries.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div>JAMES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>It is not in my power to avoid laughing
when I see any one fall in a ridiculous
manner; when the Doctor’s wig
fell off, he looked so droll—I cannot
help laughing, even now, when I think
of it.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c002'>

    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>JAMES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>No, it is not want of compassion;
and yet it is true I cannot keep myself
from laughing: I wish I knew the reason.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Let us try to find it out. Suppose
you saw a man without an arm or a leg,
who did every thing in an awkward
laughable manner, yet an inclination to
laugh would be instantly restrained by
fear of offending an unfortunate fellow-creature:
but let the hat fly off on one
side, and the wig on the other, and then
you instantly laugh, without remembering
a leg or an arm may soon be broken.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div>JAMES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>I believe you are right.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>It is best, then, to fix your attention
on the severe pain a person may suffer,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>and then your involuntary laughter
would subside into pity.</p>

<p class='c007'>You fear, then, that your heart is not

    <div>JAMES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>No, not so neither, for I declare to
you, I was very sorry when I saw Dr.
Bartlett had hurt himself, and then I
had no inclination to laugh.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Then I am right; the laugh ceased as
soon as you gave way to compassion, and
of course this thoughtless unfeeling
mirth may be restrained. Indeed if you
had considered a moment, you would
have felt the impropriety, and been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>ashamed of yourself; what, laugh when
a respectable old man had hurt himself!—Dr.
Bartlett now entered, and we
changed the subject.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the evening we went a walking
together, and passed by a miserable hut,
at the door of which a poor old blind
man stood. His grey hair hung about
his hollow cheeks, which poverty seemed
to have deeply marked; it was wet with
the labours of the day, for he had been
turning a wheel, as I found afterwards;
his trembling hands were supported by
a crutch, on which his chin rested, and
his clouded eyes were turned up to heaven
without receiving a ray of light.
You shall hear the conversation that this
sight produced.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>What unhappy wretches there are in
the world! look at that old man, cousin.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>

    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>JAMES.</div>

you pain.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c002'>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>He is blind and old, I cannot help
pitying him.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div>JAMES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>But your pity will not restore his
sight: let us go on, it is growing dark.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>No, I must first ask him if he has any
children.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div>JAMES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Nonsense! Why should you ask him
such a question?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Because it would relieve me to find
that he had good children; I should not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>then think him so unhappy, they will
certainly wait on him, serve, and comfort
him. We next spoke to the old man,
and I heard with pleasure that he had a
worthy daughter, who works hard to
maintain him, and he himself, sometimes,
turns a wheel, and does other
things, that blind men can do.</p>

<p class='c007'>My cousin’s fondness for tricks now
led him to commit an act of cruelty
that made me very angry. I gave the
blind man a trifle, and James, when he
left the house, felt in his pocket a little
while, and then flipped something into
his hand, saying, there is a guinea for
you. Joy was visible in every feature
of the old man’s face. We stepped forward.
How I love you! exclaimed I,
you have done a noble action. And do
you think I would give a guinea to a
stranger, replied he. I interrupted him,
with surprise,—You told him so; what
did you give him? It was only a new
shilling.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>Vexation and anger tied my tongue:
at last I could not help speaking with
some resentment. Such a trick does you
little honour; deceit is a detestable
thing when done to procure any advantage;
but what extreme cruelty to sport
with the poverty of a blind old man.
Did not his look of pleasure wound your
conscience? You must have a heart of
stone if it did not touch you! Fine
preaching! exclaimed he; and he caught
hold of my arm to make me quicken
my pace, but I rushed from him, and
obeyed the impulse of my heart. I returned
to the old man, thrust a guinea
into his hand, and soon overtook James,
who then appeared ashamed, guessing
what I had been doing, for I dropped the
subject, and only mention it to you.</p>

</div>

<p class='c006'>I am now arrived at the farm, dear
William; the day is just beginning to
dawn; the farmers are going whistling
to work, whilst I am writing to my
friend. You know I have been accustomed
to rise early, and it would be now
irksome to me to lie in bed the sweetest
hours of the day. I am, at this moment,
sitting near an open window, and the
birds, just awake, are hopping from
branch to branch; the flowers seem revived
by the dew; in short, there is a
delightful freshness in the morning
which gives me a new flow of spirits.
Is this, thought I, casting my eyes
around, the desart my mother supposed
would prove dreary to me? I am going
to take a ride, in order to visit some of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>the tenants houses, and even the little
huts, that I may be able to give my father
a just account of the estate, and
prevail on him to relieve those I find in
distress.</p>

<hr class='c008'>

<p class='c007'>I am now returned, and will give you
an account how I have spent my time.
I was particularly affected by the sight
of an old infirm woman, who had taken
the charge of two children, when their
parents, her son and daughter, suddenly
died. They were unexpectedly snatched
away, and left their helpless orphans
entirely destitute, with no relation to
look up to for support during their infant
years, except a grandmother, who
was scarcely able to earn a subsistence
for herself. The house, or rather the
hut, in which I found them by accident,
did but just screen them from the inclemency
of the weather. My father
would not let his dogs live in such a
wretched hovel. As I was riding
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>leisurely along, my attention was roused
by the sobbing of a little girl of about
six years old, who cried bitterly; a boy,
still younger, stood by her, and desired
her not to cry, for he would fish it out.
They then ran to a well, and I dismounted
to follow them, and enquire
what they had lost, fearing they
might fall in. And what do you think,
William, it was he wanted to fish up?
Alas! a little piece of bread that his
sister had dropped into the water, which
was very muddy. Let that dirty piece
sink, said I, I will go into the house for
another piece for you. No, no, said the
poor girl, again weeping, she has none
for herself, nor any money to buy a loaf
to-day. I often put in my pocket a
piece of bread to give my horse on the
road, I had now half a roll, which I
immediately gave her. Joy beamed in
her countenance, she smiled amidst her
tears, and breaking it into two, gave
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>half to her brother; my heart was
moved, I could not be satisfied with having
given to two human beings only the
morsel I designed for my horse. Their
hut was at some distance from the village,
to which I found the old woman
could seldom crawl; I was determined
to go and procure them a breakfast, and
again mounted my horse, rode to the
village, and entered a chandler’s shop,
and bought some bread and cheese. The
man behind the counter viewed me from
head to foot; I felt at first a little
ashamed, and then felt vexed with myself
for being so. I quickly returned to
the hut, and was, indeed, a most welcome
visitant. The children kissed my
hand, and the old woman, when I gave
her half a guinea, almost wept for joy.</p>

<p class='c007'>I intend particularly to recommend
these poor objects to my father’s notice,
and meanwhile have given orders that
the hut should be repaired, and some
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>fuel and provisions sent them from the
farm.</p>

<p class='c007'>I could not forbear, as I rode home,
continually anticipating the pleasure I
should experience, when I saw them
again in a more comfortable abode, with
a little garden and some other conveniences;
since they suffer enough without
having the wind rushing through every
corner of the house, and the rain oozing
through the thatch when they are
in bed. When I am a man, I hope I
shall never forget the resolutions I have
now made, one of the principal is,
to see myself that my poor tenants and labourers
always have a comfortable warm
habitation; I will try too to remember
that health is more necessary to them
than to the rich, and that it is my duty
to render their situation easy. Adieu.</p>

<p class='c006'>I am now again with my good Dr.
Bartlett at a small, but pleasant, country
seat, belonging to a widow, his sister-in-law,
who has but one daughter, an
agreeable, and indeed a very handsome
girl. As she has always lived in the
country with her mother, she has had
time to improve her understanding, by
reading to her books calculated to improve
a young mind. Dr. Bartlett has
kept up a constant correspondence with
her, in which they have discussed
the different subjects of her reading;
such as natural philosophy, geography,
astronomy, and history. But these employments
have not so engrossed her
time, as to prevent her learning to sing,
draw, and dance; nay, the Doctor tells
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>me, that she has, for a year or two past
and she is now but eighteen, had
the management of the house; she rises
so early that all family affairs are settled
before breakfast, and do not interfere
with her other employments. Henrietta
sings, works, and reads, all the day, and
I never saw any one have a finer bloom,
or a more cheerful countenance. The
Doctor calls me. Adieu.</p>

</div>

<p class='c006'>Dr. Bartlett went this morning
to visit an old friend, and left me to
comfort the females, as he, smiling,
said, who would have been quite disconsolate,
if they had lost both their
beaux at once. I enjoy here all the
pleasures of the country; ride, walk,
and go on the water, with the sons of a
neighbouring clergyman, whom he has
educated himself. They are modest,
sensible young men, and so far advanced
in their studies, that I felt yesterday
evening, after our conversation, a little
vexed with myself for not having made
a better use of my time; I shall rub the
dust off my Greek and Latin books
when I return to Grandison Hall. Yet
in spite of their knowledge, they have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>not neglected accomplishments; I assure
you, we had, yesterday evening, a very
good concert, in which they bore a part—but
I am interrupted.</p>

<p class='c007'>I have been very much shocked—a
messenger brought me a letter from my
poor cousin Edward, scarcely legible,
for it must have been written by a
trembling hand—in short, William, he
has been wounded in a duel, and intreats
me to come to<a id='t59'></a> him. Heaven knows what
danger he may be in; and as to his antagonist,
the letter is quite silent in this
respect; I fear, lest he should have the
blood of a fellow-creature on his head.
What can I do, his letter is very pressing,
and the danger immediate and
great; I do not like to go without consulting
my tutor; and yet, if I wait for
it, Edward may expire before I see
him; besides, I do not wish to interrupt
the pleasure he has promised himself in
the society of an old college friend,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>whom he has not seen these ten years:
Harry, too, is gone with him.—I must
consider a moment—Well, my friend,
I am going; they are now saddling my
horse, and the kind mistress of the
house has recommended an honest young
man, who is acquainted with the road,
to accompany me. As the Doctor is
not expected home these two or three
days, I hope, before his return, to send
him a more satisfactory account of an
affair, which I know will make him very
uneasy, for he has always considered
his pupils in the light of children.
Should he return before my letter can
reach this house, his sister will account
for my conduct, which meets with her
approbation. Farewell, I have at least
forty miles to ride before night.</p>

</div>

<p class='c006'>I am writing now by Edward’s bedside;
he has received a very dangerous,
but I hope not a mortal wound, though
his fever is very high. Young Atkins,
who was his antagonist, set off for
France an hour after the duel. From
every account I can gather, he was the aggressor;
a trifling joke at the mess, after
dinner, so exasperated this furious man,
that he loaded Edward with the most opprobrious
epithets. Edward was obliged
to take notice of them, or quit the
army with dishonour. Such are the false
notions that prevail, that a man of real
courage must risk his life when a drunkard
or a fool insults him; that life
which is only due to his country, is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>sported away in consequence of a
drunken frolic. I am glad, my friend,
I am not in the army, I should not like
to appear a coward, or enter into a broil
to obtain the name that every boaster,
who neither fears God, nor loves his
friends, purchases with the blood of a
fellow-creature. I hope, however, I
shall never be in such a situation.</p>

<p class='c007'>Edward is now asleep; it would be
cruel to remind him that he was ever
too fond of a jest; how often have I
seen him give extreme pain by laughing
at some peculiarity, or catching up some
strange expression to play on, and hurt
the feelings of the person who uttered
it, whose visible distress never silenced
his laugh.</p>

<p class='c007'>I will give you some account of my
journey, when he is again disposed to
sleep; now I must go and take some refreshment,
as I feel myself very much
exhausted.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>I will now give you the promised account.
I sat off the moment after I
had finished my letter; the day was uncommonly
hot, and the heavy sandy
road very unpleasant, as we could not
ride so quick as we wished to do. My
heart, which seemed ready to fly to
Edward, was very anxious and impatient;
but what could impatience avail,
it only served to make the time appear
longer. This anxiety, and the hot beams
of the sun, gave me a severe head-ach,
and I was glad, after riding three or
four hours, to meet with a comfortable
inn. I was obliged to rest a short time
my head was so very bad, but my earnest
desire to go forward soon roused me, and
prevented me thinking of being overtaken
by the night, for the sun was setting
apace. We were assured the roads
were very safe, and a genteel looking
man informed me, that he had frequently
travelled the same way himself
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>when there was no moon, without any
apprehension of danger; he then added,
that as we seemed to be in a hurry,
he would advise us to take a short cut
through a wood, by which means we
should gain two miles.</p>

<p class='c007'>We followed the advice of the stranger,
but when we were in the by-road,
it appeared so gloomy, that I was sorry
we entered it; not a single man did we
meet during the space of half an hour;
at last we heard, at a distance behind us,
some persons on horseback in a full gallop.
I stopped, not thinking of any
danger; on the contrary, having been
a little afraid of the dreary solitude
which then surrounded us, I was glad
to hear human voices; it was to me,
at that moment, almost as if I had seen
a friend; but how egregiously was I
deceived. We were quickly overtaken
by four stout men, who fiercely demanded
my money. It was to no purpose
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>to parley with them, and I was
obliged to give up my watch, purse,
and even my great coat. Happy may I
think myself that I escaped with my
life, for I was so imprudent as to speak
to one of them, whom, to my great
astonishment, I discovered to be the
very well-dressed man who directed
us to take this road; I did feel very
angry, and would have given the world
to have punished him for his perfidy.</p>

<p class='c007'>Behold me, then, without a coat; my
honest fellow-traveller offered to lend
me his, which they did not think worth
taking from him, but he seemed less
able to bear the cold of the night than
myself, so I would not accept of his
offer. We then spurred our horses and
rode on, and tried to laugh at our adventure,
in which, indeed, we did not
make a very noble figure; though it
would have been fool hardy to have attempted
to resist four strong men, something
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>like fighting a windmill, or storming
the moon. Why then do I feel a
little hurt at having been robbed? To
say the truth, that fellow’s treachery
vexed me more than the loss of my
money: but I have gained something by
my experience; I will never talk of
my own affairs when I am travelling, or
too soon make an acquaintance on the
road. Farewell.</p>

</div>

<p class='c006'>Edward is much better, which
gives me great pleasure on every account;
his hot-headed antagonist may
now safely return to his regiment. Edward
was very anxious about him: if I
should die, said he, when the surgeon
thought him in danger, pray intreat Sir
Charles to endeavour to obtain a pardon
for young Atkins, who has only his
commission to depend on; he is passionate,
I knew it, and yet provoked
him by my unfeeling jest; if I recover,
I will be more prudent for the future. It
gave me great pleasure to hear him talk
so; and I hope this illness will make a
good impression on his mind.</p>

<p class='c007'>Three o’clock in the afternoon.—What
an agreeable surprise—my father is just
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>arrived, and does not disapprove of my
conduct! He turned pale when he heard
of the robbery, and thanked heaven that
had preserved him a son, whose loss he
should have deplored with his latest
breath. I tell you this in the pride of
my heart; how sweet is the praise of a
parent! Edward was glad to see him,
and acknowledged his fault. I must not
be long absent from this dear parent.

<hr class='c008'>

<p class='c007'>Well, here I am once more with my
good friends. I reached home without
meeting with any disagreeable occurrence,
and my tutor received me with
his usual kindness, but I observed a
gloom on his countenance which made
me very uneasy. Before he went to
bed, he began to write a letter, and was
visibly agitated while he was writing.
As I know the Doctor has such firmness
of mind that a trifle would not affect
him, I was very desirous to know what
was the matter, and I think my curiosity
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>arose from affection, yet I
am afraid it has led me to act wrong,
for when he left the room for a moment,
I crept softly to his writing table
to read the unfinished letter. It was to
a brother who had sustained some heavy
loss in trade, which involved him and a
large family in the greatest distress. I
suddenly threw down the letter, before
I had read half of it, as if I had been
committing a robbery, and severely reproached
myself for having pryed into
his secret, though I think I was led to
it by the restless anxiety I felt when I
saw him unhappy; but this does not
excuse me—I have been very much to
blame—I blush for shame—I have injured
my friend, and I have injured myself;
I shall be afraid to look him in the
face; what a coward does guilt make us!
I can write no more, I am out of humour
with myself.</p>

<p class='c006'>Pity me, my friend; Dr. Bartlett
has just received a letter from Grandison
Hall; he instantly informed me, with
seeming emotion, that there was not
the least danger, but that my mother
was ill, and that if I pleased, we would
set off in the morning. Do you say,
my dear Sir, if I please; my heart is
there already; my mother in danger,
and her son so far off! I never was so
low spirited in my life; I am sure the
Doctor softens the matter to me. I received
a few lines from Emilia, delivered
privately to me by the servant,
which made me very uneasy; I will
transcribe part of it.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>“Dear, dear Charles,</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>“What a misfortune happened yesterday!
our dear mother suddenly fainted,
and I was afraid she was dead;
I was alone with her, sitting at
my work, and did not perceive her
change countenance, so that she was on
the ground before I could afford her any
assistance. My loud cries brought the
servants, but not before I had got my
arm under her head: I kissed her forehead,
and called upon her a hundred
times, as if I could recall her to life.
The surgeon soon arrived, and bled her,
and in about half an hour she came to
herself again. But what did I suffer
during that dreadful interval! I wished
a thousand times that you were here.
Do not delay a moment, dear brother,
if you love me; I shall be much
easier, I know, when you are with me.
We shall assist each other in nursing
her, for I will never leave her a moment
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>care of strangers; I remember how she
Sat up with us when we had the smallpox
and measles, and if she was out of
danger, I should feel a pleasure in convincing
her, that I love her as dearly as
she loves me.”</p>

<p class='c006'>This is a short transcript, William,
of my dear girl’s letter; for with a full

</div>

<p class='c006'>My mother is out of danger; my
sister’s letter made me very apprehensive;
the tenderness of her nature makes her
tremble at the least indisposition that
attacks her parents, and she exaggerates
the danger, till she is unable to see
things as they really are. But why do
I blame her? What have I not suffered
myself through anxiety, in my way
hither? I sometimes feared my mother
was already dead, and we appeared to
ride too fast forward: I was afraid to approach
the hall one minute, and the next
was in a violent perspiration through my
eagerness to reach it. In short, William,
I had a continual palpitation at my
heart, and now find myself by no means
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>well. But I shall not complain; in the
morning probably I shall be better.</p>

<p class='c007'>The time draws near, the time I so
eagerly look for, when I was to have
visited Holland: all my hopes seem like
a dream, and it appears to me wrong
even to think of it. I will go and take
a little walk in the garden, it may, perhaps,
refresh me.</p>

<p class='c007'>I do not seem much the better for
my walk, but I am glad I went, and I
will tell you why. As I was going
down the lane by the side of the garden,
which you know leads to the high road,
such a weariness came over me I was
obliged to sit down. After resting some
moments I rose up, and without considering
where I was going, turned down
the public road. May we not suppose,
William, that heaven directs our steps
to be serviceable to our fellow-creatures?
for I saw, as I advanced, not far from
me, a little child about three years old; it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>seemed tired, and stood still when it
perceived me. At first I supposed some
person was near; but not seeing any one,
I began to be uneasy, and when it
turned from me offered it some flowers
which I had gathered in my way; this I
did with a smiling aspect, and enquired
what was its name, and where it lived?
It could only lisp out a few words, such
as that its name was Jemmy, and that
it lived yonder, pointing with its hand,
I could not tell where, for you know
there is no house near; I could only
make out that it had been a long time
seeking its mammy.</p>

<p class='c007'>The evening was growing dusky, and
still no person appeared; I quickly
imagined the poor mother’s feelings when
she missed her child, and would have
given any thing to have been able to
have restored him to her; but as that
was impossible, I was determined to
take him with me, and leave him at our
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>gardener’s house, till he should find out
to whom he belonged. I was obliged
to carry him, for he began to cry, when
he saw we turned out of the high road,
and I found it rather troublesome on
account of my weakness, but my resolution
gave me strength, and I gave it in
charge to the gardener’s wife, who promised
to take care of it. In the morning
a servant is to go to the neighbouring
villages to enquire about the mother.
Farewell.</p>

</div>

<p class='c006'>My mother is now out of danger, my
dear Charlotte, but Charles went to
bed last night very ill, and is it to be
wondered at, after the perturbation of
mind he has lately gone through? Heaven
preserve me such a brother! The
time seemed so long while he was away,
that I do not know how I should live
without him.</p>

<p class='c007'>He found a lost child last night, and
brought it in his arms to our gardener,
and desired him to take care of it until
we could find out the mother. She came
this morning, and informed us, that
she had been all the night wandering
about in search of it. I was very much
affected by the poor woman’s gratitude;
but would you believe it, a certain young
gentleman presumed to say to Edward,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>this morning, that he thought Charles
had acted imprudently: what would
he have done, added he, if the child had
never been claimed? Did you ever hear
such cold-hearted reasoning, Charlotte?
Who would have thought of such a
thing, when the poor child was in such
immediate distress; yet this same prudent
gentleman took home, some time
ago, only actuated by pity, a great dog
that ran after him. Edward told him
of this, and asked him how it was possible
that any one who could have so
much pity for an animal able to preserve
itself from danger, and find something
to eat, should have so little compassion
for a helpless child? He was at a
loss what to say, and soon after took his
leave, as I must do for the present.</p>

<p class='c006'>You desire that I will send you as
early an account as possible of Charles’s
health; he is, I fear, very ill. In order
to conceal it from my mother, he tried
to employ himself, but in vain. I am
with him every moment I can leave my
mother; and this morning we had a
conversation, which I will relate. He
asked me to put by his drawings, and he
looked so altered, that my eyes filled
with tears, and I turned my head from
him to conceal them; but it did not
escape his observation. He caught me
by the hand, and said, Why, dear

</div>

<p class='c007'>My tutor has often told me it is no
sign that God does not love us, because
we are in affliction. Sickness and sorrow
are as necessary for us in this world
as every other event; we are in the

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>No, my dear, we have no more reason
to fear upon our sick bed, than
when we are in lively company, taking
a walk, or on the stormy sea. We are
always under the protection of our Creator;
he can preserve us, or call us
hence whenever he thinks fit.</p>

<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>We <i>appear</i>, you say, but that appearance
deceives us, and we are led to
think so because God commonly calls
us out of the world by sickness; this
seems the usual way, and we suppose
that death is at a distance when we are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>in a confirmed state of health; yet we
are, in the very midst of our pleasures,
near the grave. For instance, when you
are singing, or dancing, a dreadful fire
may burst out, and none may have
power to escape; nay, without such an
unforeseen accident, a single glass of
cold water, after such an amusement,
has often occasioned death. Who would
then presume to say, that they have
many years of pleasure to come?</p>

</div>

<p class='c006'>I have another proof to give you of
Charles’s good disposition, but first let
me tell you he is much better. After
I had finished my letter to you yesterday
evening, I went into Charles’s room
again, and found him and Edward looking
over some drawings; amongst them
was the mount of a fan, which Charles
had finished with more than usual care,
intending to surprise our dear parent
with it. Though he is very modest
when speaking of his own performances,
yet he spoke of this with some degree
of satisfaction, and mentioned the length
of time he had been about it. He desired
me to cover it with silver paper,
adding, that he would rather lose all the
rest of his drawings than this.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>We were now called down to supper;
about half an hour after we were
seated at table it began to rain very fast,
and Charles recollecting that he had left
one of the windows of his room open,
was going himself to shut it, but my
mother called him back, not thinking
it safe that he should expose himself to
the night air, and desired one of the servants
to go.</p>

<p class='c007'>Well, we went to bed at our usual
hour, but I had scarcely reached my
room before I heard Edward cry out,
What do I see! I ran to him, and judge
of my vexation, when I saw the fan
mount in his hand almost entirely consumed:
Charles at that moment entered
the chamber; he said nothing, but
looked a little angry, supposing we had
played him a trick. What think you,
said Edward? the careless boy that did
this deserves to be turned out of doors.
No, said Charles, I was afraid you had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>done it to teaze me; if it was only an
accident, though it is vexatious, I will
endeavour to remedy it by doing another
much better: however, let us enquire
about it. They did so, and the
servant who had shut the window,
owned that he had put a candle on the
table which was loose in the socket,
and that it fell out, and set fire to the
paper, and almost burnt the whole
mount, before he could put it out.
The boy seemed very sorry, and begged
Charles not to tell his father, lest he
should be turned away for his carelessness,
for he had often been desired never
to put a candle on a table covered with
papers. Edward would not listen to
him, and said it was all a lie; but
Charles said it was not impossible,
and that he would not mention it to
his father or mother, as he should be
sorry to have a servant turned away who
appeared to be sorry for what he had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>done, only desired him never to touch
any papers again in his room.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div>EDWARD.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Well, you are very good-natured,
Charles; if this had happened to me, I
should never have forgiven him.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>That would not have restored my
drawing.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div>EDWARD.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>No, but the careless fellow would
have been punished; and that would have
been some comfort: such a loss would
vex my very heart.</p>

<p class='c007'>No, I do not call it a misfortune,

    <div>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>You make me smile—I shall soon
forget my drawing, it was only a trial
of temper; my mother’s sickness was a
misfortune, indeed, and the poor woman
who had lost her child had reason
to weep; but what admits of a remedy,
should not be called a misfortune, it is
only a momentary vexation. And after
all, I was the person to blame, it was I
who was careless; if I had locked up
my drawing, or shut the window myself,
this accident would not have happened.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>

<p class='c007'>But, Charles, will you begin another?</p>

    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Yes, certainly, and perhaps it may be
much better, for another design has just
entered my head.</p>

<p class='c007'>He then wished me a good night, and
I must do the same.</p>

<p class='c007'>I am glad I did not entirely fill up my
paper, and yet I shall not say much, I
am so dull. Edward has just left us to
join his regiment. My tears fall while
I write. I do not like these separations;
I wish those whom I love were
always to remain with me!</p>

<p class='c007'>Charles has just mentioned to my
father, a circumstance that he appeared
to be much ashamed of. I have not
time to write the particulars; I can only
now tell you, that he read a part of one
of Dr. Bartlett’s letters, without his
leave; he saw the Doctor in great distress,
and was so anxious to know what
occasioned it, that he acted contrary to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>his own notions of honour. This letter
contained an account of some misfortunes
that had befallen the Doctor’s family,
which he, from a motive of delicacy,
concealed from my father, thinking
he had already done too much for
them.</p>

<p class='c007'>My father went instantly to his friend,
with whom he had a long conversation,
and after he returned to his study, he
sent for Charles, and mildly addressed
him.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div>SIR CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>I have at last prevailed on my friend
to state the whole affair to me, and it
will soon be settled to his satisfaction.
And now let me caution you, my son,
never to let even your affection induce you
to pry into the secrets of others: a good
end does not justify the improper means
employed to reach it. Honour is a sacred
thing, and no motive should influence
us to trifle with fixed principles-our
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>views are bounded, and we ought
to adhere to strict rules, not knowing
how to modify them. Your youthful
warmth now pleads in your favour; I
am acquainted with the goodness of
your heart; but goodness should ever
be restrained by duty, or it will not
uniformly actuate our conduct.</p>

<p class='c007'>My father then smiled on Charles,
adding, this is a caution, and not a reproof.</p>

<p class='c007'>I have almost written another letter.

</div>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div>Dear Grandison,</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>I have been very uneasy on your account,
and need not tell you what a relief
it was to my heart to hear of your
recovery. I neglected my music; all
my employments were a task to me,
whilst I imagined you were sick; the
sorrow is now over, and I only dream of
seeing you; surely it will not be long
first.</p>

<p class='c007'>I will now relate a circumstance that
does not do me much honour; but it
will relieve me to confess my fault.</p>

<p class='c007'>A few weeks ago, when my mother
received her annuity, she made me a
present of twelve ducats, that I might
buy myself a new coat before you came;
but as the clothes I brought with me
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>from England are yet very good, I determined
not to purchase it till just before
I set off for England, that I might
have something new to appear in before
Lady Grandison and Emilia. Last week,
however, when my mother and sister
were visiting a friend for a few days, a
young gentleman of my acquaintance
came to drink tea with me, and mentioned
by chance that a bargain had
fallen in his way that very afternoon.
A handsome new coat, that had never
been worn, had been offered him very
cheap, by a person in distress, and that
he should certainly have bought it, had
it not been rather too little for him.
Being less than him I thought that it
might fit me, and enquired, with some
earnestness, if he would buy it for me.
Very readily, he replied; I will get it
this evening. He asked ten ducats for
it, but I dare say you may have it for
six. Accordingly he sent it me in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>evening; and I found it, as he said, very
good. I must confess it pleased me.
Ten ducats were demanded for it; I offered
eight, and at last gave nine, convinced
that it was very cheap.</p>

<p class='c007'>I then thought how agreeably I should
surprise my mother. When she returned
home, I eagerly brought the coat,
and asked her what she thought of it,
and if it pleased her? She replied, exceedingly,
but this undoubtedly cost
you more than twelve ducats? Much
less, interrupted I; I gave no more than
nine for it. I looked at her, expecting
to see her smile, but, to my great surprise,
saw her assume a very serious
countenance, saying, that coat is worth
fourteen or fifteen ducats, and did
you buy it for nine? I had a better
opinion of your principles: the person
who sold it was probably impelled by
poverty, and could you find in your
heart to give but half the value for it?—could
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>you defraud the poor? Would
you not, every time you put it on,
think with concern of him whose misfortunes
you took advantage of. Ah!
my dear mother, I have done wrong:
you really think it worth fourteen ducats,
I will instantly go and seek for the
owner: my cousin made me a present
yesterday, to buy something new with
before I went to London; let me do
justice, and give my six ducats to the
necessitous owner of my coat whom I
inconsiderately injured. Indeed I would
not add to the misery of the unfortunate.
Go, William, replied she, and let it
make you more prudent for the future;
a man of honour must never buy any thing
for less than the value, because it is always
sold by a person in distress, or by
Some one who has obtained it in a dishonest
manner, and with such, an honest
man must have no dealings. To overreach
a person in any respect is worse
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>than a robbery, because here you do not
expose yourself to any danger. A mean
action is generally done to save money
for some selfish pleasure; justice is the
foundation of every virtue, and he who
does not respect himself, will never be a
virtuous character.</p>

<p class='c007'>I was ashamed of my fault, as you
may suppose, and could not be easy
until I went to pay the money, and
make an apology for my conduct. I
found that the coat was bought of a
young man whose mother was in great
distress; my heart smote me when I
heard of it. How glad I am my mother
showed me this action in its true
light; for having heard many people
speak with pleasure of a bargain, I
thought I had done something very
clever.</p>

<p class='c007'>I have learned from this accident to
distrust my own judgment, and shall
constantly apply to my mother for advice,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>till I have more experience to
judge for myself. How painful it is not
to have the means of doing good, for I
now think I ought to have sent back
the coat, and to have made that dutiful
son a present of the money; but then
my mother could not afford to buy me
another coat when I want it, and I must
submit to my circumstances. Farewell,
my dear Charles; remember me to all my
kind friends at Grandison Hall, not forgetting
Emilia.</p>

</div>

<p class='c006'>What a fright have I had, and what
anxiety and distress have I gone through!
I must tell you all, and I know you will
pity me. We were allowed yesterday to
pay a visit to a gentleman, whose seat is
about two hours ride from our house.
Harry, our faithful Harry, (who came
to live with us again after the death of
his mother) went with us.</p>

<p class='c007'>We spent a very pleasant day, and set
out again for Grandison Hall about half
past five o’clock. Harry seemed rather
to lag behind, and we every now and
then waited for him. We were conversing
some time without thinking of
him, when Charles looked round, and
immediately perceived that Harry was
not with us. I was alarmed, and I saw
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>that Charles was distressed. I think I see
him yonder, said he; we will return,
perhaps there is something the matter
with his horse. We returned accordingly,
but Charles went a little before
me, because he was afraid of discovering
something dreadful. And so indeed it
proved. Never shall I forget the horror
I felt when I saw Harry stretched
motionless on the ground, the horse
standing by as if he wished to take care
of his rider. I called out for help, not
recollecting there was nobody within
hearing; Charles quickly dismounted,
and bid me make myself easy: easy,
cried I—alone in this solitary road in
the evening with a dying man. Charles
had advanced to Harry in the mean time,
and assured me he was not dead. I
would then have got off my horse, but
my brother desired me to sit still; notwithstanding
this, I jumped off without
thinking, and immediately the horse
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>ran away. My brother had pulled off
his coat to lay under Harry’s head.
Harry still remained insensible. Imagine,
Charlotte, my distress; I saw my
brother was very much perplexed; but
I will give you our conversation.</p>

<p class='c007'>My dear Charles, what will you do,
it is dark already?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>I hope some traveller will soon go by
who may afford us assistance. But where
is your horse, my dear?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div>EMILIA.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>My horse!—it was here just now. I
was so anxious about Harry, that I did
not perceive when he left me.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>He will find his way home; it cannot
now be helped; but you should
have secured him, sister, when you dismounted.</p>

    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>EMILIA.</div>

<p class='c007'>It was very foolish, but I was so desirous

    <div>CHARLES.</div>

    <div>EMILIA.</div>
  </div>

<p class='c007'>Dear brother, I am very anxious, who
knows what may happen to us in this
lonely road; we have nobody with us.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div>CHARLES.</div>

<p class='c007'>Do not let us be too solicitous about
our own safety; do you not see a fellow-creature
dying near you: and can
you think of the trifling inconveniences
we may be exposed to?—God is with us.</p>

<p class='c007'>He uttered this in a solemn tone of
voice, and then looking at me with tenderness,
entreated me to be calm. Picture
to yourself now your friend Charles,
without his coat, upon one knee, holding
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>his right arm under Harry’s head,
and with his left softly rubbing his
temples: and every now and then he
turned his eyes to heaven, and I saw
the tears streaming down his cheeks.</p>

<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div>CHARLES.</div>

<p class='c007'>No, Emilia, he is yet living—perhaps
he might yet be restored, could I
obtain any help. God be merciful, said
he, I cannot afford him any assistance—what
shall I do?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>No, we must not go and leave a man
to his fate who is insensible: he would
not have served us so: misfortunes level
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>all imaginary distinctions in life: he
would have ventured his life for us;
we must do as we would be done by.
How attentive was he to me in my last
illness!</p>

<p class='c007'>Here the tears came again into his
eyes.</p>

<p class='c007'>It may not be necessary; we must first

none? I should never be happy if I left

<p class='c007'>Can you suppose so, Emilia?—Oh,

Try to calm your mind, my

    <div>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>They will think that Harry is with
us, and that we are very safe.</p>

<p class='c007'>Charles then suddenly started up, and
I saw Harry struggle violently:—for
heaven’s sake, Emilia, walk away a little,
said he, Harry is in a fit. I did so, for
I was terrified. I turned round a moment,
after hearing Charles cry out,
Gracious God, Harry is dead, sister.—I
was going to speak, but he begged
me to compose myself; and then stood
silently five or six minutes till he was
certain the poor man had breathed his
last. Charles took his coat, which lay
under Harry’s head, and spread it over
the body. While he was doing it he
trembled very much, for I held his arm,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>afraid to go from him, when I saw, for
the first time, a corpse. At last a violent
flood of tears relieved him, and he took
my hand, saying, now it is time to go—we
have nothing more to do, for he is indeed
dead. He made me get up behind him,
as I was afraid to leave him. Oh, Charlotte,
it is a dreadful thing to see a fellow-creature
die! I shall never forget
that evening.</p>

<p class='c007'>We rode forward with great speed;
and I could scarcely believe that we had
left Harry behind, it all appeared like a
frightful dream. About two hundred
yards from the house, we heard two
horses in a full gallop, coming towards
us. I trembled like a leaf, and dreaded
lest some new misfortune awaited us;
but how great was my joy when I saw
my father himself with Robert. I
found they had all been in great confusion
on account of the return of my
horse, which one of the servants saw
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>quietly feeding on the lawn. I cannot
describe to you, my dear, with what
fond affection I flew into the arms of
my tender mother, who had undergone so
much uneasiness on our account; I
scarcely thought myself in safety till
she pressed me to her heart—how glad I
was to see all the people alive round
me.</p>

<p class='c007'>While I related the event, Charles
sent a servant to take care of the body.
My father said it might have been better
had we returned immediately for assistance;
yet he believed that he should not
have left him in such a situation had he
been there himself. I know you will
be glad to hear that we are not much
the worse for our fright, and that I am
sincerely yours.</p>

</div>

<p class='c006'>Drive away your fears with respect to
a sea voyage, my dear sister, for mine has
been a very speedy one, though we were
overtaken in our passage by a dreadful
storm. You know on shore I can talk
very philosophically of a storm as highly
necessary to purify the air; but on the
sea, where the view is almost boundless,
and one seems particularly exposed to
its fury, I felt myself struck with a solemn
kind of dread: it was as if the
clouds were pouring with accumulated
fury, from the four quarters of
the heavens, to burst over our heads.
Never did I observe the lightning with
so much attention as in that wide extensive
prospect. It really was a fearful,
but at the same time a beautiful sight;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>I trembled while I gazed, I do not pretend
to deny it; and the distress of
some of my fellow-travellers almost infected
me with fears that my reason
condemned, until I began to think it
was a kind of mistrust of the goodness
of heaven, which I had so often experienced,
when I gave myself up to
unreasonable fears. I soon, then, grew
more composed, but I was moved with
indignation when I heard the foolish
jests of two gay young fellows after
the storm was over; for it appeared to
me almost impious to mock at so awful
an appearance, in which God made his
almighty power very manifest.</p>

<p class='c007'>When the waves began to subside, I
viewed with reverence the wonders of
the deep; and asked myself from whence
came this lightning and rattling thunder?
What causes the clouds, which
consist of water, to produce such a tremendous
clatter? You know that philosophers
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>have discovered that thunder
is only occasioned by the compression
of the clouds, and that the lightning
is the effect of this concussion. But let
us change the subject.</p>

<p class='c007'>There were amongst the passengers a
respectable looking old man. I could
not take my eyes off him. He had the
appearance of a gentleman, but his
clothes were thread-bare; and I found
by his conversation that he was a Dutchman.
He had laid up for himself but
a slender stock of provision: my heart
suggested that he must have been unfortunate;
and I perceived him several
times lost in thought. I endeavoured,
without intruding on his sorrows, to
engage him in conversation, as he spoke
English very well for a foreigner. What
he said was so sensible and interesting,
that he prejudiced me in favour of the
people I was going to visit; in short,
none of the passengers pleased me so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>well as he did; perhaps, because I
thought him unhappy; I could think of
no one else. I at last drew him into
conversation: we talked together during
the storm; and I offered some of my
provisions to the other passengers, that
I might, without seeming to have observed
his scanty stock, press him to
partake of mine. He then enquired if
my parents were living, and, wiping a
tear from his eye, he softly said, Happy
are they to have such a son! I read the
thoughts of his heart, Emilia; I guessed
the source of his uneasiness. And you,
Sir, replied I, perhaps you have children?
Alas! answered he, yes, I have
children—I have a son, but he has not
a heart like yours; I left him in London:
heaven bless him! may he never
feel the pangs he has made me endure.
I wished to have said something more,
but I was afraid he might think my
curiosity impertinent, as I was so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>young; yet I sincerely felt for him.
This circumstance threw a damp over
my spirits—I cannot bear the idea of
those children who are ungrateful to
good parents, whom, next to God, they
ought to honour. I desired Robert to
enquire who he was, but the captain
knew nothing more, than that he was
an inhabitant of Amsterdam, and in
distress, for he had not money sufficient
to pay his passage, and offered to leave
his small bundle of linen on board, as a
security for the payment, while he went
on shore to borrow it. No, thought I,
that must not be; but how shall I
manage the matter? I was in a dreadful
dilemma—it would have been almost an
affront, if I had offered to make a person
of his appearance a present. I went
down into the cabin without having
taken any resolution. At last I determined,
and folded ten guineas in a
piece of paper, sealed it, and wrote his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>name on it, which I had heard accidentally.
I then spoke to the captain,
who appeared to be a humane man, and
requested him to deliver that paper to
the gentleman after I had gone on shore,
but not to say who gave it to him. The
captain seemed pleased, and added, that
he carried him over to England some
time ago, when he was in a better
plight, but that he feared his wild son
had distressed him in more ways than
one.</p>

<p class='c007'>Robert saw afterwards the captain
give the gentleman the money, whilst I
hastened forward, lest he should suspect
me. Do not mention this circumstance
to any one, my dear sister; my
father, you know, gave me above fifty
guineas to spend in this tour, and I
could well spare this sum.</p>

<p class='c007'>Sleep sound, my dear sister, and in
the morning I will return to my letter,
and give you some account of my meeting
with my friend.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>IN CONTINUATION.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>It was evening when we arrived at
my friend’s native place; they did not
expect us that day. The servant who
opened the door, told me her young
master was at home alone; she conducted
me into a small apartment, and
was going to call him down. You
know, Emilia, that I love a trick in
which there is no mischief; I then desired
she would conduct me to the room
without telling him of my arrival. I
crept to his chamber door, which was
half open: he was playing on his violin
one of the lively songs we had often
sung together when he was in England.
I immediately began to accompany him
with my voice: his violin was instantly
silent, and he listened a moment to my
prolonged note, then he darted out of
the room, and soon discovered me behind
the door. After we had embraced
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>each other, he overwhelmed me with
questions, not forgetting how Emilia
looked, how she sung, &#38;c. &#38;c. He
wished me to have some refreshment;
but you know I never eat any thing between
meals.</p>

<p class='c007'>We chatted delightfully together, expecting
Mrs. D— home every moment;
mean while I cast my eyes round the
room: the walls were hung with his
own drawings; neatness and order were
conspicuous in every thing. This little
solitary apartment, said he, must seem
to you very homely after Grandison
Hall? It is just that neat simplicity
which suits my taste, answered I; it is
all adorned with your works; you look
cheerful, and are sincere, what more is
wanted to give dignity to the place?
How much more honour do these drawings
do you, which are a proof of your
diligence and skill, than the most excellent
pictures, which are purchased
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>for show, by those who do not even
know their value. On his table stood a
cabinet which looked so beautiful that I
was curious to examine it, but how surprised
was I, when he told me it was
only pasteboard, which he had made
himself, and ornamented with landscapes
and wreaths of flowers. He told
me he intended it for a young lady
whom he highly esteemed. Will you
listen, Emilia, while I whisper in your
ear who I think that lady is—your
noble self. These, said William, are
my employments. I draw, read, and
play on my violin; then I have my
mathematical instruments and my box
of tools; I declare the day is not long
enough for all I have to do. And it is
very happy for me that I can amuse
myself, as my mother’s circumstances
are so confined, I could not keep company
with my father’s relations and
friends, without leading her into expenses
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>that she could not well bear.
And believe me, Charles, added he, I
never will condescend to be <i>intimate</i>
in a family where I am considered in
the light of an inferior: of course I will
never receive any favours in the style of
an humble companion. What noble
principles, Emilia! how glad I am to
have such a friend!</p>

<p class='c007'>Mrs. D— returned soon after with
her daughter Annette. My friend introduced
me to his mother, saying, behold
the friend whom I love next to
yourself. William had reason to praise
his mother, for there is a sweetness in
her manners that charmed me more than
I can describe, and a look of sorrow that
makes her very interesting. Annette is
a pretty lively girl, but her gaiety does
not render her remiss in her duty, for
she watches her mother’s looks, anxious
to anticipate her wishes. She immediately
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>enquired about you, and expressed
a great desire to be acquainted with you.</p>

<p class='c007'>We are going to take a walk with
Mrs. D—, so I must finish my long letter:
I have written by the same post
to both my father, mother, and Dr.
Bartlett. Across the dreadful ocean,
which you fear so much; I send you
my good wishes. God bless you!</p>

</div>

<p class='c006'>The order and regularity which reigns
in this family would surprise you, considering
they have but one servant. Mrs.
D— sees but little company—a few particular
friends, and the society of her
children, is all she wishes for. She is
always employed; and William reads to
her, in the evening, history and books
of rational amusement, which she comments
on, and frequently repeats his
father’s sentiments of the various authors
they read, which William treasures
up, and often transcribes in a little
book, which he has made for that purpose.</p>

<p class='c007'>He keeps the accounts of the family;
and, under the direction of his mother,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>manages her little property. In the
evening, just before bed time, something
serious is read, and Mrs. D—, repeating
a short but fervent prayer, recommends
us to the protection of the Almighty.
We rise early, and William and I
go on with our former studies till we
meet the ladies at breakfast.</p>

<p class='c007'>Annette has no master but William:
he teaches her reading, writing, and
arithmetic; drawing she begs as a favour;
and we all instruct her in the
French and English languages; and you
can hardly imagine what a progress she
has made.</p>

<p class='c007'>William’s cheerful diligence excited
my admiration; and I could not help
mentioning it to him yesterday in terms
of praise. How, my friend, said he, is
it not my duty to communicate to her
the knowledge that my mother has
procured for me at a great expence? I
am happy that I can by my zeal in this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>respect, prove that I am grateful for her
constant kindness; besides, is not the
dear girl my sister, and is not her welfare
and happiness of the greatest consequence
to mine? I find myself richly
rewarded for my trouble, when I see
her gradually improve; and I think all
elder brothers and sisters ought to do
the same when their parents are not in
affluence.</p>

<p class='c007'>What do you think I have done,
sister? I have given up my regular correspondence
with you to William, not
that I shall forget to write sometimes,
but as I have many letters to write,
which I must not neglect, and wish to
finish some drawings I have sketched of
this place, I cannot write to you in
such a circumstantial manner as I wish
to do, without depriving myself of the
company of my friends. William, you
know, has the knack of writing particulars,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>and he can write to you while
I write to my father, Dr. Bartlett, &#38;c.
You must answer his letters, and not
refuse to write to my best friend, if you
love me.</p>

</div>

<p class='c006'>May I presume to write to you, dear
Miss Emilia; your brother desires me
not to fear your displeasure. I have not
been much accustomed to write to
young ladies; you must not, then,
laugh at my blunders, and I am sure my
subject will interest you, for I shall
tell you what your brother does and
says, as I used to tell my mother.</p>

<p class='c007'>The appearance of our country pleases
him, and I endeavour to let him see as
much of it as I can. Yesterday we
went to Leyden, one of the most beautiful
cities in Holland. We visited the
university, and saw whatever else was
worthy of observation. It would certainly
be a matter of regret to my friend
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>to leave Holland without seeing the
public buildings and other curiosities.
We had very fine weather: Robert accompanied
us. Your brother chose to
go in one of the Trekschuits rather
than in a carriage. I cannot refrain
from relating to you the following adventure,
which does your brother so
much honour.</p>

<p class='c007'>Coming a little too early, as we were
walking backwards and forwards, we
saw two young gentlemen, genteely
dressed, who came from Leyden, and
were waiting as well as ourselves, for
the schuit. They appeared like persons
of rank not well educated, with
that mistaken pride which leads a person
to look down with disdain on those
whom they imagine to be their inferiors.
It was particularly conspicuous in one,
whom we heard the other address by
the title of baron. What a contrast
there was between his and your brother’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>manners! Soon after came a poor
Jew boy, he looked sick, and had a
basket on his arm with small wares in
it, which he offered to us for sale. The
two young gentlemen  soon cast their
eyes on him, and began to laugh, handing
his basket backwards and forwards,
pretending to look at what it contained.
Great people sometimes think they may
do any thing because they are rich. The
jokes seemed to displease your brother
not a little, and he turned away several
times to avoid hearing them. But the
thoughtless young men were not satisfied
with a trifling joke, they pretended
to buy the whole basket, and promised
to pay him his full demand, which was
five guilders, provided he would bring it
to Leyden to the house of a Mr. Vanderk.
The young Jew was exceedingly
glad, and danced for joy, as perhaps he
might not have sold as much in two
months.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>The skipper, and a man I knew,
was present at this transaction. Your
brother quickly observed, that there
was some cheat intended in this purchase;
and, after the gentlemen had
stepped into the schuit, questioned the
boy, who informed him that his mother
was sick, and on her account he rejoiced
that he had sold the whole together: he
added, that he should immediately set
off for Leyden, and return in the evening
with the money to his mother, who
was in want of it. Charles then desired
the skipper to take the boy in the
schuit, and paid the fare, saying, you
heard those gentlemen buy the boy’s
basket of wares? Yes, answered the
skipper, and I too, said another man,
but it is only a trick, for there is no
such gentleman as Mr. Vanderk in the
whole city of Leyden: they only mean
to let him have his walk for his pains,
and will laugh all the evening at the
fine trick they have played a Jew.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>The poor Jew was happy to find he
was to go in the schuit, for he was
scarcely able to walk on account of an
ague. We then went on board, and
while we were standing at a distance
from the rest, we had the following
conversation.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div>WILLIAM.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>I perceive, Grandison, what your generous
heart meditates; you intend to
give the poor boy the five guilders,
which they promised him for his wares.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>No, this trick, or rather vile deceit,
raises my indignation; I think that they
deserve to be punished, to teach them
more thought and humanity in future.
The haughty baron shall pay the five
guilders himself, or I am much mistaken.
You may recollect that I asked the skipper
if he had not heard them bargain for the
basket, and an honest man, you know, also
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>offered to bear witness: if I was to pay the
money, it would be a kind of encouragement
of the cheat, and perhaps heighten
the jest. It is our duty, as much as we
can, to assist our fellow-creatures, and
to hinder one man from injuring another.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div>WILLIAM.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>You excite my wonder; I had not
extended my thoughts so far.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>It is not the loss of the five guilders that
will affect the baron; a person so rich, as
the skipper informs us he is, cannot think
much of such a small sum; but he will,
at least if he has any virtue, be ashamed of
his foolish conduct: it shall be made
public; his own companions will blush
for him, and the joke will be turned
against himself.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>WILLIAM.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>I did not think you had been so severe,
Grandison. Your humane heart
has often——</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>You are mistaken, William; indifference
in this case would prove rather
that I had a weak than a good heart.
I may forgive a cheat practised on myself,
and I would do it as far as was
consistent with my honour, but I must,
when I see a fellow-creature deceived,
exert myself to maintain his right.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div>WILLIAM.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Many who are called Christians think
there is no harm in cheating a Jew,
but my mother has given me a very
different definition of humanity.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>A Jew is a man as well as we are,
and we ought no more to cheat a Jew
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>or a Turk, than we would a Christian:
we must not despise, much less hate,
those who profess a different religion:
created by the same God, we are all
brethren.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div>WILLIAM.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>But how will you contrive to get the
five guilders from the baron?</p>

<p class='c007'>The approach of the gentlemen interrupted
us, and your brother stood
musing a short time.</p>

<p class='c007'>We were now to change schuit, and
went into a public house, where we
were to stay half an hour to get a little
refreshment. Your brother called me
aside, sent for Robert, and ordered him
to pay the Jew five guilders. How,
said I, you have changed your mind!
No, said he, it shall be repaid out of
the baron’s purse, if my plan succeeds
according to my wish. When you,
continued he to Robert, have paid the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>money, bring the boy into the house,
the rest will follow of course.</p>

<p class='c007'>We then went into the coffee-room,
where the two giddy young men were
drinking and teazing a great dog. Robert
quickly followed, with the Jew
boy and his basket, for as they were in
a different part of the schuit, they supposed
he was gone on foot to Leyden.
But I must give you, verbatim, the conversation
that passed between them and
Charles on that occasion.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div>BARON.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>How came this boy in the schuit?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Sir, your generosity in purchasing all
this poor little merchant’s ware, by the
sale of which, he assists to maintain a sick
mother, had such an effect on me, that I
determined to pay his fare, because I
perceived that he had an ague on him,
which has weakened him in such a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>manner that he would scarcely have been
able to walk to Leyden, much less to have
returned back to night. But my servant,
who just now came in with him,
felt so much compassion for him when
he saw him so sick in the boat, that he
has done a great deal more, he has
given him the five guilders, and taken
charge of the purchase, that the boy
may return without any delay, and he
will himself deliver it at the house of
Mr. Vanderk.</p>

<p class='c007'>The baron and his friend soon perceived
your brother’s design, and looked
very foolish, and the eyes of all the
people in the room were fixed on them.
They stammered, and knew not at first
what to answer. Your brother, with
his usual presence of mind, called the
skipper, and said, you undoubtedly
know Mr. Vanderk, of Leyden, to
whose house those gentlemen have directed
the young Jew; if you will go
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>with my servant, when we arrive there,
I will give you something to drink.
The worst of all is, said the skipper,
that in all Leyden I do not know where
to find a gentleman of the name of Vanderk.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>That gentleman, pointing to the baron,
will have the goodness to inform
you.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div>BARON.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>I do not know any gentleman of that
name at Leyden: we only meant to
amuse ourselves a little with the young
rogue.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>That amusement is well worth five
guilders: it is to you gentlemen the
wares must be brought, and that is just
the same; my servant is not afraid of the
payment.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>Every one now began to laugh, and
the baron and his friend seemed ashamed
of themselves. An honest burgher,
who was in the room, cried out, with a
look of contempt, the prank is really
well recompensed. Another pitied the
poor Jew, and thought it very inhuman
to have sent a child, shaking with an
ague, so many miles to no purpose; for
every one perceived that the poor boy
would have got nothing, and after having
long sought for Mr. Vanderk, he
must have returned back with his wares.
At last the jokers, with very serious
faces, paid Robert the five guilders, and
to take off part of the odium from themselves,
they desired the boy to keep his
basket and wares, which they could
make no use of. Your brother ordered
the boy a warm breakfast, and paid his
fare back to the Hague.</p>

<p class='c007'>We were then called to go on board
again, and the baron and his friend were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>cured of their airs for that day at least.
What a long letter I have written! Permit
me, however, to assure you, that I am
your most humble servant.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>LETTER XXV.<br> <span class='large'><span class='sc'>Charles</span> <i>to</i> <span class='sc'>Emilia</span>.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>My friend William has acquitted
himself so well, that I have very little
more to say of our late excursion. I
shall soon be with you to tell you all, as
our voyage to England is fixed for the
end of next month. Your brother is
grown very idle, and our time is almost
entirely lost in amusements. We walk,
or ride, from one village to another;
go to the play, pay visits, &#38;c.
Yet, now I think of it, I cannot call
it time lost, I endeavour to get all
the information I can respecting the
customs and dispositions of the people I
am now with. I shall send them to Dr.
Bartlett, and as he has been frequently
in this country, he will rectify my mistaken
opinions when I return. Indeed,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>I wish to see as much as I can, for I
should be ashamed, when any one asked
me what I had seen in Holland, to be
only able to speak of the air, the ground,
the sun, the houses, the fields, the cattle,
without being able to add, that the
air is warmer or colder, the houses better
or worse built, the fields more or
less fruitful than in England; in short,
not to be able to give a discriminating
account of the country and the manners
of the people.</p>

<p class='c007'>I will now give you a slight sketch.
The Dutch appear to me to be sincere
and honest; they have the politeness of
the French without their levity. Their
peasantry and mechanics are the most
industrious set of people I have ever
seen, and so honest, that it is as safe in the
evening and night in the streets as in the
houses. We hear of no duels, murders,
or robberies; nor any of those
dreadful vices which prevail so much
in England, or of those barbarous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>diversions which please the mob in our
country. We never hear of a boxing
match for money; nor do they fight
cocks, or bait bulls; so that they appear
to be a mild people.</p>

<p class='c007'>The land is fruitful and well cultivated,
and the climate, I am informed,
very wholesome; I only regret the year
being so far advanced, that I shall not
see half the beauties of the country on
that account.</p>

<p class='c007'>We are going this afternoon to a village
in the neighbourhood of this place.
Annette has just now left the room,
after shewing me her writing, which
her young master had praised. But why
do not you lay aside your work for an
hour, and write an answer to William?
or we shall not be good friends.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>LETTER XXVI.<br> <span class='large'><span class='sc'>William</span> <i>to</i> <span class='sc'>Emilia</span>.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Your brother mentioned, in his last
letter, that we were going to take a
walk; the weather was very fine when
we set out, but the sky looking a little
cloudy, I proposed to your brother to
go in the schuit. How, said he, are
you afraid of a little rain, we have no
clothes on that can be spoiled? Let us
not guard against every trifling inconvenience:
and so we went on. When
we reached the village, which was rather
a long walk, we went into a coffee-house
to drink tea to refresh ourselves.</p>

<p class='c007'>While your brother was reading the
newspaper I walked in the garden, and
saw, in a disorderly company, a young man,
a distant relation of my mother’s, whose
father the other day had dined in company
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>with your brother. We both of
us then observed his melancholy countenance,
and my mother hinted to us,
that she feared his son’s disobedience was
breaking his father’s heart. I was alarmed
at seeing him in such company, and
enquired of the landlord how long he
had been there. Four days, answered
he, and during that time, he has spent
fifty five guilders with the companions
you see. He has given me a bill for
the money, signed by Mr. H—— at the
Hague, which I am to receive next
Monday. This speech made me very
uneasy, for I perceived by it he had
altered his name. The landlord called
him Mr. S——; and I knew his name to
be Van Landbergen, and this made me
suspect that the bill might be forged.</p>

<p class='c007'>I ran to your brother and acquainted
him with the circumstance. It may fairly
be inferred, answered he, that as he has
taken a false name, he may also have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>been guilty of forgery. Such a shameful
action will bring the old man to his
grave; but we must try to prevent it,
let us send for the landlord; and he
rang bell. He soon entered, and your
brother thus addressed him: “I hear, Sir,
you have a bill drawn on Mr. H——,
payable next Monday; I will give you
the money for it, as I have some accounts
to settle with that gentleman,
but you must give me your receipt, and
mention that it was for Mr. S——.” The
landlord was glad to get his money
without the trouble of going for it, and
immediately wrote the receipt and received
the money; he then left the
room, and we had the following conversation.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>You think that this bill may be
forged, and so do I; and if it should
really prove that we are right in our
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>conjectures, what would be the lot of
young Van Landbergen, a shameful flight,
or scandalous punishment; either of
which would grievously have afflicted
his innocent parent. We must one day
give an account of what heaven has intrusted
to us, and what would my account
be, if I could only say, I had the
means in my hands to save a good man
from a misfortune which might have
fatal consequences, and I chose rather to
spend my money in useless diversions
and selfish pleasures. If the bill is
good, I shall be no loser; if not, it
will be a source of perpetual satisfaction
to think that I delivered a good
father from the shame his ungrateful
son would have entailed on him.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div>WILLIAM.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>What an example! There are many, I
know, that may possibly, this very evening,
lose above fifty guilders at billiards
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>or some other game, who yet would call
your act of benevolence madness.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>That is their business, my friend.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div>WILLIAM.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>But, if you present the bill to Mr.
H——, will not the forgery be made
equally public?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>That is not my design: it is to young
Landbergen himself that we must present
it. You have often wished me
to be acquainted with him; now this
bill, if it is not a good one, will give
me an opportunity of introducing myself
to him in the light of a friend.</p>

<p class='c007'>We requested the landlord to bring
him into our private room, and he came
accordingly, not knowing who sent for
him. As soon as he saw me, he seemed
disconcerted, which we did not notice
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>and your brother civilly asked him to sit
down, and the following conversation
ensued.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>It gives me particular pleasure to
meet with the son of worthy Mr. Van
Landbergen, with whom I dined last
week at Mrs. D——’s house; and you
will, I hope, pardon me, if I embrace
this opportunity of commencing an acquaintance
with his son.</p>

<p class='c007'>Young Landbergen bowed in great
confusion, with his eyes cast down,
twisting his hat round upon his hand.</p>

<p class='c007'>Charles seemed not to observe his confusion,
pulled the bell to order a bottle
of wine, and the conversation continued.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Your father is a worthy sensible man,

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div>WILLIAM.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>You are going, no doubt, to the
Hague this evening, Mr. Landbergen;
we may all go together, if it is agreeable
to you.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>It would give us particular pleasure,
as we intend calling on your father.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div>LANDBERGEN.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>I am waiting here for a friend, so that
it will be late before I can go—otherwise——</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div>WILLIAM.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Then we shall be deprived of the
pleasure of your company, for we promised
to be home early, and our design
was to call and inform my mother that
we intend to sup with your father.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Can you inform me, Sir, where Mr.
H—— lives; I have a small bill drawn on
him by a Mr. S——: I received it from
the landlord.</p>

<p class='c007'>Landbergen looked pale at this question,
and without seeming to hear him,
started up and looked out of the window.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div>LANDBERGEN.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>I fear we shall have heavy rain this
evening.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>I do not think so, the sky looks very
clear.</p>

<p class='c007'>He then took the bill out of his
pocket-book, casting a look at the same
time full of humanity at Landbergen.
The culprit’s confusion was now very
great, the bill he instantly knew, and
every limb shook at the sight. Your
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>brother offered him a glass of wine,
but he let it fall, and was going hastily
to leave the room. Charles, who
was now fully convinced of his guilt,
caught him by the hand in a friendly
manner. No, Sir, you must not leave
us, the sight of this bill seems to have
raised a strange perturbation in your
mind. Open your heart to me, I respect
your father, and wish to esteem
you.</p>

when I tell you, that on leaving my
father I stole a small sum he had saved,
in order to try my fortune at cards; I
had already lost a great deal of money
with the same people, whom I now
wished to play with again.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Yes, certainly; you weep; those tears
do you honour; your heart is not bad,
but it has been too weak to resist the
allurements of vice in bad company.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div>LANDBERGEN.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Yes, I have acted a base part, and by
neglecting my duty, have lost an eligible
employment. And yet I never deliberately
did wrong. I have always intended
to reform for I hated myself
when I thought a moment; and shunned
my father’s eyes as if I dreaded they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>would dart death on me. I frequently
ran out, to avoid thought, and forget
remorse, at the gaming-table. Nay,
even when I have only gone to take
a walk, and determined not to spend
any money, or lose my time, the sight
of one of my companions, a single
word, banished all my good resolutions,
and I followed him wherever he chose
to lead me.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The only means to conquer this
weakness, is resolutely to determine to
employ yourself, and never to allow
your imagination to dwell on scenes
which are likely to inflame it. You
were formerly fond of reading, I hear,
and have made some progress in music;
return to those rational employments;
visit us when you have finished your
daily task; we have got some new
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>music. I have sometimes heard my
tutor advise a young man, who, like
yourself, had a good heart, to frequent
the company of modest women; there
are many young ladies at the Hague
who will be glad of your company if
you act with propriety: and their society
will make you feel disgust when
you mix with young people who have
lost the charm of innocence.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div>LANDBERGEN.</div>

<p class='c007'>But can this ever wash out the stain
of a false signature?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Undoubtedly it may; forget this signature,
as I shall.</p>

<p class='c007'>(Saying so, he tore the note.)</p>

<p class='c007'>See there the small offering which
I make to your repentance and return
to virtue. Your father knows nothing
of this: let us conceal it from him.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>Landbergen embraced his young benefactor.
We both observed that he
was very much moved: he grasped
Charles’s hand, and could only say, I
owe my preservation, my peace, to
you.</p>

<p class='c007'>Had you seen, at this moment, your
brother, Miss Emilia, you would have
been delighted. The most heart-felt
satisfaction seemed painted on his countenance.
We then left the house, and
during our walk home, we endeavoured
in vain to raise Landbergen’s spirits; he
appeared oppressed by a sense of his
fault.</p>

<p class='c007'>We found the old gentleman his
father at home: he received us with
the highest satisfaction, and was struck
with astonishment to see his son enter
with us. He viewed him with tears
in his eyes, exclaiming, What my son!—Your
brother caught hold of each
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>of their hands, and joining them together,
whispered the father, “Forgive
your son, he is truly penitent.”
The son could not speak, he sighed,
and his tears fell on his father’s hand.
The father also was speechless; but soon
recollecting himself, he said, how shall
I interpret this deep concern! heaven
grant it may be sincere! It is sincere,
exclaimed the son, eagerly; see the gentleman
to whom I am indebted for all
this. He has saved me from shame,
and raised me from meanness, by his
noble generosity. I earnestly wish to
distinguish myself by acting properly:
speak, Mr. Grandison, my father may
know all.—Your father does know all,
since he knows you repent. We are
both young, we have still a character to
obtain in the world; let us struggle for
a good one. Let all disagreeable reflections
be now laid aside. You shall hear,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>said he, taking down young Landbergen’s
violin, how well I can play a
Dutch tune.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>LETTER XXVII.<br> <span class='large'><span class='sc'>Emilia</span> <i>to</i> <span class='sc'>William</span>.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>My brother reproved me in his last,
for not having answered your letter. I
will now write a long one to make
amends; and, following your example,
tell you minutely what I have been
doing since my brother left me. My
mother has allowed me a new amusement,
which I hope you and Charles will have
a share in when you return. It is a
weekly concert, which our music master
directs at the different houses of a
select number of his scholars. He
thinks, and my mother agrees with
him, that it will very much improve us
all.</p>

<p class='c007'>The daughter of the Earl of B—,
who is one of the party, has rendered
herself very contemptible by her pride
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>on this occasion. But first I must tell
you, that the music master had introduced,
as one of his best scholars, the
daughter of an apothecary. Haughty
Lady Jane shewed great displeasure when
she saw her enter. The beauty and
pleasing manners of that young lady
was nothing in her eyes; she was neither
rich, nor of a good family; that was
sufficient to excite her contempt. Miss
G. the young lady in question, is really
a very fine girl; educated by her mother,
she has received the most useful instruction;
there was a modest dignity in
her manners, the very contrast of Lady
Jane’s haughty affected air. There
was the same contrast in their clothes,
the latter had on a profusion of costly
finery, huddled together according to
the fashion; but the former was dressed
in the simplest style; it did not make
you suppose she was rich, but it was
so well calculated to make her person
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>appear to advantage, that you quickly
perceived her sense and taste. Lady
Jane snuffed up her nose as we sometimes
see people do when they are afraid
of smelling something disagreeable.
Heaven! said she to me, what does that
creature do here; I think I smell drugs.
Having said so, she took out her lavender
water bottle: I pretended not to
hear, and turned to Miss B. with whom
I chatted a little. This, perhaps, was
not very polite, but I could not help it,
for I despise such foolish pride. Lady
Jane afterwards played an air on the
harpsichord, and accompanied it with
her voice in a very imperfect manner.
Soon after it was Miss G——’s turn, and
she sung, with great expression, a favourite
song: her voice is really a very
fine one, and every one seemed delighted
with her performance. Envy at first
was painted on Lady Jane’s countenance:
but it did not stop here, for she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>made an excuse to withdraw with me.
And we had the following conversation.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div>LADY JANE.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>I do not doubt, Miss Grandison, but
you are of my opinion, that this girl is
not fit company for us.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>You have, perhaps, some reason for
saying so; for my part, I do not know
why she may not be one of the party.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div>LADY JANE.</div>
  </div>

<p class='c007'>We are all persons of rank, and the

daughter.</p>

<p class='c007'>I am not the daughter of a peer, of

    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>LADY JANE.</div>

</div>

<p class='c007'>My father has taught me that virtue
is the best nobility. The young lady of
whom you are speaking, is allowed to
be a very amiable good girl.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div>LADY JANE.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>That may be, I have nothing to say
against her character; but I repeat it,
her father is an apothecary—her grandfather
was an apothecary, and her—</p>

<p class='c007'>If you run on thus, Lady Jane, to

that she is nearly related to you and

<p class='c007'>Yes, certainly, you must allow that

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div>EMILIA.</div>
  </div>

<p class='c007'>I speak as seriously as I can.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div>LADY JANE.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>It is not proper that a girl who has
no fortune should force herself into the
company of people of rank.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div>EMILIA.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Our company is not expensive, and
she did not force herself; on the contrary
her musical talents make her an acquisition
to the concert.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div>LADY JANE.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>But look at her dress.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div>EMILIA.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Her dress is certainly not rich, but
neat and elegant. You may yourself perceive
that she has good sense and taste,
by the choice of her clothes; without
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>servilely following the fashion, she avoids
singularity. She is besides a very fine
girl. Thus God, who gives riches to
some, gives to others natural endowments,
which many would purchase at a high
price; all come from the same benevolent
Being, in whose sight virtue only
exalts a weak mortal.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div>LADY JANE.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Miss Grandison appears to be preaching
a sermon.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div>EMILIA.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Forgive me if I do not coincide in
opinion with you; my heart is too sincere
to dissemble.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div>LADY JANE.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>I shall not dispute about her natural
gifts, but I say once more, that a girl
who has no fortune ought not to be
put on a par with people of rank and
fashion.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>

    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>EMILIA.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>It would be very unfortunate that a
girl, who had received a good education,
should be deprived of every innocent
pleasure because she has no fortune. I
for my part would rather endeavour to
contribute something to afford her the
means to——</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div>LADY JANE, <i>hastily</i>.</div>
  </div>

<p class='c007'>Indeed you make me laugh. This is

brings with it.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c002'>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The contempt which poverty brings
with it, say you! you astonish me. They
must certainly be very unfeeling who can
shew any contempt for a well educated
person in low circumstances. Such a
one I think deserves to be despised.</p>

    <div>EMILIA.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The world then is very mean and
selfish. I hope I never shall despise any
one who is not vicious, and even those
I have been taught to pity rather than
blame.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div>LADY JANE.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>You are <i>very</i> good; but since we
must submit to the general opinion,
shall I desire the music master to inform
the girl, whom we are speaking of, not
to let us see her again in our company—or
I shall decline coming.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div>EMILIA.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>You may do as you please; but you
must allow me to tell him that I do not
concur with you.—I then made her a
cool curtsy and withdrew.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>She wrote to the music master; but
all the rest of the company insisted that
he should not comply with such an unreasonable
request, and deprive us of our
best performer, who was in every respect
a desirable companion. My mother took
particular notice of the young lady in
order to give her consequence, and told
me, after she was gone, that she had
not for a long time seen so modest and
well educated a girl.</p>

<p class='c007'>So ended this foolish affair. My mother
and I had a long conversation on
the subject; I have not now time to repeat
it, but she animadverted very severely
on that foolish pride that makes people
neglect to attain the real personal consequence
which can only arise from virtue,
and value themselves on the accidental
advantages of birth, riches and
external ornaments, which do not constitute
the pre-eminence of a rational
being. These cannot follow them to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>the grave. Farewell. Remember me

</div>

<p class='c006'>I have need of your advice, dear
brother. You know that my mother
designed some months ago to let me
have a waiting maid, and she has ever
since been enquiring among her acquaintance
for a proper one; and she
hired one last week who had been particularly
recommended to her. But this
is not all; I discovered Charles, before
she had been with me two days, that
she was very unhappy, and I perceived
when she was dressing me that she had
been weeping. This affected me very
much; I attempted to comfort her and
find out the cause of her grief, and at
last I discovered it. Why Lucy, said I,
do you cry so much; tell me the reason,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>my good girl? consider me not as your
mistress, but as your friend; perhaps I
may be able to alleviate your sorrows.
She could not speak, and pressed my
hand in which I was holding her’s; in
short, my pity for her, or as she expressed
it, my goodness, gave her courage, and
she told me that the lady who recommended
her had concealed her real name.
Her father had been a naval officer, and
that her mother, by his death, was reduced
to extreme poverty. She added,
that she was now afflicted with a lingering
illness without any means of support;
and that to be enabled to assist her she
determined to go to service, and was
accordingly recommended to me by the
lady who had assisted her mother. You
may imagine what I felt, and I exclaimed,
I will go directly to my mother, she is
very compassionate. Poor Lucy held me
back; for heaven’s sake do not do it!
keep my secret. Let me serve you; let
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>me have the satisfaction of finding a
friend in a mistress, for what will become
of me if I leave you? My mother
made me promise not to mention my
name; and she will never forgive me if
I make her distress public.—I was at a
loss what to resolve on, at last I said, I
will keep your secret provided you live
with me as a sister. But Charles, have
I done right in keeping a secret from
my mother? I wish I had not made the
promise; yet on the contrary I must
have parted with this good girl; but I
considered again, I ought not to think
of myself, I ought to persuade my mother
to assist her. Dear Charles will you
send me your advice, I shall not be easy
till I hear from you, pray write soon. Do
not mention this affair even to William.</p>

<p class='c007'>Fly swiftly a few weeks, and bring
my dear Charles to us! In the course of
a month we expect to see you. My
mother had several times tears in her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>eyes when she read William’s account
of you: how happy are we when our
parents are satisfied with us! God certainly
loves you Charles, because your
parents do. And you would see that I
love you if you could read my heart.
Farewell my dear brother.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div>Dear Sister,</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>You must not keep the unfortunate
young lady who has entered into your
service, you must let her go back to
comfort her afflicted mother. Emilia
is much too tender and humane to bear
with the attendance of an equal to gratify
herself. You know my mother’s
goodness; excuse me, but I must say that
your sensibility was ill placed when you
promised to conceal the matter from her.
She who formed your heart to virtue is
better able to advise you than I am.
Her liberality will provide for that unfortunate
girl some other means of supporting
her mother than that of being
your waiting maid. Nay, what an honour
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>would it be for my Emilia to do
without one, and give her wages to a sick
widow. My sister knows well enough
how to dress herself, and such a pleasing
reflection would render her little troubles
sweet. Let the mean spirited Lady Jane
glory in having useless servants, Emilia
Grandison will find more satisfaction in
waiting on herself to be able to do more
good. Delay not a moment my dear.
Now, without any loss of time, you must
mention every circumstance to my mother;
how much would it distress you if
the girl’s parent was to die without your
being able to effect your humane design.</p>

<p class='c007'>But what surprise do you speak of, in

by what, shall I be surprised? I shall
play you a trick for this. However, I

<p class='c006'>A letter from Emilia—from the

pleasure! you are indeed an amiable girl—how
far do you outshine the haughty

perhaps our conversation may entertain

<p class='c007'>You have reason to be so, she deserves

think like Lady Jane, and satisfied with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>a distinguished rank, do not seek to obtain
real excellence, by improving their

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>I acknowledge it, but you must have
observed that nothing is more humiliating
than pride; the respect that is paid
to a proud person is only a mere compliment,
or done through interested motives,
which degrade the person who
pays it. It is a mere farce to bow to a
being we despise.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div>WILLIAM.</div>
  </div>

<p class='c007'>I believe so. I have more than once

<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>And what avails their greatness and
wealth to their fellow-creatures, if they
live only for themselves. We ought
then only to be proud of virtue and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>charity; nay, not even of them for they
are duties, and the performance of a duty
ought not to excite pride. They only
are truly great who set a good example
to others; a distinguished rank is indeed
a blessing when it enables us to do more
good.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div>WILLIAM.</div>

<p class='c007'>I think a proud man cannot love his

<p class='c007'>There appears a sort of cruelty in

“How have I deserved you should look
down upon me with such contempt. You
are rich, I am poor; this is your good
luck and my misfortune, but you should
not make it heavier by your scorn, as I
certainly have not injured you. If I ask
you for any thing you may refuse me,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>and I must be content. I undergo many
difficulties; go on foot in the rain,
without sufficient covering to screen me
from the keen wind; benumbed with
cold, and almost sinking under my misery:
you, on the contrary, ride in a carriage,
and feel none of these inconveniences.
I bow civilly to you, and you turn away
your head with disgust, while the wheels
of your coach throw the dirt in my face.
Your cruel contempt adds to my sufferings,
when a smile would have lightened
them. You despise my poverty, and
force me to recollect that one man is as
good as another, in order to comfort
myself and not repine at my fate. If you
keep your money, I shall not, I cannot,
contest with you. Riches fell to your
lot, and I do not covet them; but at
least pity me; I eat a hard crust, but
am still a man, and can feel your cruel
inhumanity.”</p>

<p class='c007'>We are going this evening to the

</div>

<p class='c006'>Young Landbergen, through the interest
of his father and some other friends,
is again restored to his office. He seems
to have a fixed resolution to adhere to
his promise, and his old father is revived
now he sees his son returned to virtue.
What a satisfaction for my friend, who
has produced this reformation. Yesterday
in my presence he returned him
a thousand thanks. You have taught
me to know what is true happiness, Mr.
Grandison, exclaimed he; I at last see
that a wicked life is no life; how dear
have I paid for my licentious pleasures,
by my uneasy remorse. Every day I fell
into new errors. Every day they produced
new difficulties. What an advantage
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>to the mind to be satisfied with
itself. How happy it is when in the
evening we can reflect upon the day
without being ashamed of our conduct.
Formerly I was afraid to pray to God,
because I had not sufficient resolution to
alter my conduct; but now I feel that
a prayer affords me comfort. I dare
hope that the Supreme Being has again
received me into favour. I lately dreaded
the sight of my father as if he was an
enemy, now he is my bosom friend. My
former companions treat me with a kind
of disdain, and that disdain is my triumph.
Yes, interrupted your brother,
it is your triumph; you have now the
esteem of better men, you make your
father’s life comfortable, and you will
not miss the truest satisfaction. I am
sorry that we are so soon to part, will you
allow me to correspond with you? Will
I? answered Landbergen; it would make
me very happy. You cannot think how
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>much he is improved in his appearance
since his return to virtue, I can scarcely
believe that the handsome young man
I now see, is the same being whose looks
almost terrified me.</p>

<p class='c007'>Our departure for London is fixed for
the 26th of next month. We often
count the hours for we all long to see
you. Your brother has just been making
me laugh. He is the life and soul of the
whole house; we shall all soon laugh
together, till then adieu.</p>

</div>

<p class='c006'>An officer was just now announced,
and who do you think it was, dear Miss
Emilia, but our old friend Edward.
What an agreeable surprise to us all!
Annette, who saw me shaking him cordially
by the hand, ran to tell my mother,
but she expected him, for Lady
Grandison, as we afterwards heard, had
acquainted her with his intention. I
would instantly have called your brother,
but Edward held me back: let us
play him a trick, said he, he knows
nothing of my coming. Perhaps the
sudden  surprise may hurt him, said my
mother. No, replied Edward, I am not
afraid of that. Charles continued writing
longer than usual in his chamber;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>when supper was ready he was called
down; Edward before had placed himself
by the fire, with his back to the
door. Charles entered, he knew him
immediately, and moved some steps
backwards, but, before he could speak,
he observed Annette’s smiling countenance,
and determined to humour the
joke. Edward, in the mean time, continued
sitting, thinking he was still considered
by Charles as a stranger. This
produced several laughable incidents;
which highly diverted Annette, and even
made my mother smile.</p>

<p class='c007'>Afterwards we spent a most agreeable
evening, and Edward made me a present
of a very elegant sword. I hesitated,
and was unwilling to receive it; not for
the world, said I; I have often heard
that it forebodes a breach of friendship.
How, interrupted Charles, can you give
way to such prejudices? Leave them to
weak minds that have never been properly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>cultivated; that foolish idea is as
absurd as the raw head and bloody bones
with which they frighten little children.
Adieu, you kept your secret very
well.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>LETTER XXXIII.<br> <span class='large'><span class='sc'>William</span> <i>to</i> <span class='sc'>Emilia</span>.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>We have been in a most dreadful
consternation occasioned by a false alarm,
but it is now over, and has not been attended
with any bad consequences. Edward
was very curious to see the environs
of this city, accordingly we went
the day before yesterday to a village that
is reckoned one of the pleasantest in
Holland; the weather was that day very
fine, considering the time of the year.
Edward and I were conversing with great
earnestness; he was particularly pleased
with the high cultivation of the land,
and the neat appearance of our farmhouses.
Charles was some paces behind
us; he stopped to assist two little children
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>who were defending themselves
against a dog, that had been, as we afterwards
heard, provoked and tormented
by some idle wicked boys; before your
brother could raise his stick the enraged
cur flew at him and bit his leg. The
children in the mean time ran away and
the dog after them, with his tail between
his legs and his mouth wide
open; he rushed by Edward, who asked
if I was not frightened, and we then
turned round to look for Charles. We
walked slowly till he overtook us; he
said nothing of the accident, and we did
not perceive a little spot of blood that
was on his stocking.</p>

<p class='c007'>When we entered into the village we
found it in an uproar. We heard nothing
on all sides but the dog is mad! the dog
is mad! and, as is usually the case, every
one endeavoured to make the story appear
more dreadful; one said that he had bit
a horse, another five cows, nay, added
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>the third, it was five men. Charles
looked pale, but we did not guess the
cause, till he pointed to the spot of
blood on his stocking, and cried out see
there,—I am one of them. We then
went into a public house, but Edward
would not stay a moment, he enquired
where the surgeon of the village lived,
and ran like lightning to ask his advice;
but, unfortunately, he was not at home.
Edward would not return without him,
and ran to the different places, where it
was supposed, he might be.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the mean time I remained with
your brother in a  situation of mind which
I declare I never felt before, in a sort of
stupefaction, which I cannot describe.
Before he sat down he put a large poker
in the fire, and once or twice I heard
the name of his parents escape from his
lips, in a voice scarcely articulate. I
went to him and caught him by the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>hand, exclaiming, in an agony, did you
visit me for this!</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Dear William, here, or in any other
place, the same misfortune might have
befallen me.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div>WILLIAM.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>But you, my friend, who are so virtuous,
whose heart is so generous, who
never neglected your duty—surely, you
did not deserve—</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div>CHARLES, <i>interrupting me</i>.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Take care, William, do not let your
friendship lead you to arraign the goodness
of God! If I indeed have endeavoured
to follow the good example of
my father, and have been a comfort to
my parents, I can with less terror view
death; if I am indeed near it. But that
may not be the case, I shall take the
step that reason suggests, and leave the
rest to God.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>WILLIAM.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Noble soul! No, I repeat it, you
merited a better fate.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Shew more respect to the Sovereign
Disposer of our destiny. Excuse my being
a little serious with you; he who
gave me being, has a right to take it
away, when and how he pleases. I
hope Dr. Bartlett’s lessons are not thrown
away upon me; with gratitude and joy
have I prayed to my heavenly Father,
when I have been walking alone in the
country—and even now I can pray to
him.</p>

<p class='c007'>He turned his eyes involuntarily up
to heaven. I sobbed, threw myself round
his neck, and could not speak, it was as
if my lips were sealed together. He
then enquired for Edward, and when he
heard that he was gone for a surgeon, he
said, friendly creature! what I dread
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>most in this circumstance is suspense,
but I must have patience. Should any
accident befall me, William, be a comfort
to my parents. I believe that the
catastrophe of this disorder is described
as much more dreadful than it really is;
few men go mad on account of the bite
of a mad dog, and I never heard of any
who communicated the canine delirium
to the friends or relations who attended
on them.</p>

<p class='c007'>He then earnestly requested me to
leave the room for a few minutes. I was
obliged reluctantly to comply; and when
I returned, caught him courageously searing
the part with the red hot poker which
he had put into the fire for that purpose.
He tried to conceal from me the violent
pain he endured; and did not utter a
single groan, lest he should increase
my anguish. Edward that moment
entered, in a transport, with the identical
little cur in his arms, crying, There
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>is no danger, make yourselves easy!
Charles turned his eyes towards heaven,
with a look of gratitude; for my part
I was almost out of my senses for joy.
The man, to whom the dog belonged,
accompanied Edward, and informed us,
that the poor creature, having been provoked
and chafed about, ran hastily home
and hid itself under a bed. The general
cry at first, he owned, made him afraid,
(in spite of his reason) that a dog, who
half an hour, before was perfectly well,
might now be mad; but that shortly after,
when he enticed it from its hiding place,
it was very glad to eat and drink, and
he perceived that the poor creature had
only been terrified by cries and blows,
and did not shew the least sign of madness<a id='r1'></a><a href='#f1' class='c009'><sup>[1]</sup></a>.
Fortunately this man lived at
one of the houses Edward was directed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>to, when he was seeking for the surgeon.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f1'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r1'>1</a>. In Holland, no dogs are allowed to run in the
streets during the summer hot months, without being
secured by a small cord.</p>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Was it not a very happy circumstance,
dear Miss Emilia, that the dog was not
killed in the scuffle, for we should still
have remained in the most painful state
of suspense, if we had not seen the animal
perfectly well. You will see the
dog, for Edward bought him, not for
his beauty, but to make Sir Charles and
his Lady perfectly easy.</p>

<p class='c007'>The surgeon soon followed, but did
not find it necessary to bleed your brother;
he applied a plaister to his leg,
which was very painful on account of
the searing. We hired a horse that he
might not be obliged to walk home on
it, and ran in high spirits by his side,
for I was afraid that my mother might
have heard of the accident before we
arrived, and I knew the effect it would
have on her spirits. What uncommon
resignation and firmness of mind
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>did your brother exhibit on this distressing
occasion! Surely true courage can
only arise from virtue. I always tenderly
loved him, but never before felt such
a degree of respect and admiration; even
when he was in the most violent pain he
thought less of himself than others.
Dear Emilia, I know your heart will
leap for joy, as does at present that of
your affectionate friend</p>

<p class='c007'>P. S. I must add a few lines to tell
my dear sister that I am perfectly well.
William has spoken too highly of my
composure; if I had had more presence
of mind, I should not have paid any
attention to what those ignorant people
said; I should have recollected how
often I have heard stories in England
about mad dogs and cats, that some
trifling accident gave rise to. Tell my
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>father and mother, and tell yourself,
that I never before felt that I loved you

</div>

<p class='c006'>We live now in a kind of continual
dissipation; our instruments, our drawings,
our books, all are packed up and
ready to be sent on board. We are perpetually
in motion, we eat, drink, sleep
and visit like those people who have
nothing to do, and try to kill time because
they do not know how to employ
it; what a miserable life must such beings
lead! Shall I tell you, that the thoughts
of taking leave of my native country is
very painful to me; I must confess my
weakness, dear Emilia; though I ardently
long to be in London, I feel the
most lively concern. Your brother commends
this weakness. It is natural, he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>says, and, in his opinion, we should be
very unfeeling, if we could leave the
country, where we have been born and
educated, without being affected. Yesterday
we paid a visit to Mr. Landbergen;
his son still behaves with the greatest
propriety; and, as the tender father
considers your brother as the instrument
of his darling’s reformation, his countenance
is always lighted up with joy at
our approach. When we entered he introduced
a French gentleman to us,
who appeared by his dress and manners
to be in reduced circumstances. There
was an appearance of mildness and good-nature
in his face that instantly interested
us. I have frequently felt myself
thus attached in a moment to a person
who had a mild and benevolent countenance.
Mr. Landbergen desired his son
to shew us two landscapes drawn by
the gentleman, in whose favour we were
so instantly interested, which were really
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>very beautiful. We could not forbear bestowing
the praises on them they so
justly merited; and I felt a little vexed
with myself when I recollected how
very inferior mine were. The young
painter very modestly received our
praises, and soon after left the room.
We then again viewed the landscapes,
and Charles remarked that he had very
pleasing manners, and very much the
air of a gentleman. Yes, said Mr. Landbergen,
he is a good young man and a
gentleman, though an unfortunate one.
He received a very liberal education,
but the loss of his parents and some
other misfortunes, obliged him to exert
his talents in order to earn a subsistence.</p>

<p class='c007'>I pity any one who loses their parents

<p class='c007'>He has been here some months, and
has not met with all the encouragement
he deserves; his modesty prevents him
from pushing himself forwards, or taking
those methods that many of inferior
abilities practise to obtain the name of
able artists. He wishes to sell those two
pictures, and, to spare him the disagreeable
task of offering them to sale himself,
I desired him to leave them here.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>

<p class='c007'>What does he ask for them?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>

  </div>

<p class='c007'>Thirty guilders.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>

<p class='c007'>He undervalues them; that is too
little.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div>LANDBERGEN.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Few think so nobly as you do, Sir;
though they are certainly very well
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>done, and very cheap, I have not yet
been able to find a purchaser.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c002'>

  </div>

<p class='c007'>I like these pieces so well I shall be

if I could draw but half as well. It is
very inhuman not to pay an ingenious
man the full price for his labour, or to
undervalue the productions of an unfortunate
gentleman.</p>

<p class='c007'>The subject was now dropped, but
when we took our leave, Charles gave
Mr. Landbergen fifty guilders for the
pictures; and as we walked home they
were the subject of our conversation.</p>

<div class='nf-center c002'>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The pieces are worth the money, and
it was incumbent on me to give fifty
guilders for them. Believe me, he who
will not, or cannot, give the full value
for a thing should let it alone, and not attempt
to defraud a person in distress.</p>

<p class='c007'>Do not suppose that I mean to blame
you; you are frugal and sparing in every
thing that respects your own private gratification,
only to have it more in your
power to be generous to others; you even
chearfully bear inconveniences which
you endeavour to guard your friends
from; nay, you are as indulgent to
them as severe on yourself.</p>

<p class='c007'>You are very obliging, Edward, but
let us be serious. Must it not be very
painful to an artist to hear his labour
and trouble undervalued, by those who
are unable to produce any thing like it
themselves; nay, is it not unjust to endeavour
to cheapen a thing, when you are
conscious that only a reasonable price was
demanded for it? In the present case,
the French gentleman was impelled by
his distress to offer them as a bargain;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>and could I take advantage of the distress
of a fellow-creature?</p>

</div>

<p class='c006'>Your brother went yesterday to visit
the painter I mentioned to you, and Edward
to read the newspaper in a neighbouring
coffee-house; I stayed at home
to transact some business for my mother.
Charles returned first, and was scarcely
seated, when Edward ran in with great
haste.—I am glad, said he, to find you
at home, I met at the coffee-house, by
chance, a poor Englishman. Will you
assist me to relieve a countryman, for
they seem to have the first claim to our
benevolence?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div>CHARLES.</div>

<p class='c007'>I do not think so; I should not ask,

countryman he was, whether he was a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>Dutchman, Englishman or Frenchman;
I should feel compassion. But where is
your Englishman? let me see him.
Come with us, William. We all
three went to the door, and found a
young man who seemed about four and
twenty, who had an appearance of extreme
poverty. Your brother Charles
expressed some astonishment; I suppose
he had prepared himself to meet an old
man, for I have often heard him say that
healthy young ones, except in particular
circumstances, need never want, and
that their distress is generally a proof
of their idleness.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>You have applied to my brother for
assistance, my friend; we will do something
for you. Who are you?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div>ENGLISHMAN.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>My father was a reputable shoemaker;
but he died suddenly, and left my mother
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>in great distress with two sons; my
brother went to service, and I endeavoured
to get some employment in London;
but after having been often disappointed,
I determined to try my fortune
in foreign parts.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Whom did your brother live with?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div>ENGLISHMAN.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>With a Sir Charles Grandison.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Was his name Harry?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div>ENGLISHMAN.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Yes, Sir; did you know him?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>I certainly knew him, and am very
sorry to find you are his unworthy brother.
So it was you who lived on your
poor mother, when she was a widow
and in great distress; it was you who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>used to borrow money of your brother
to buy liquor with; and when you left
your drunken companions, you went
home and abused your aged unfortunate
parent.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div>ENGLISHMAN.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Oh, Sir! pray hear me out; I have
done all I could to get work here; and
have severely smarted for my folly.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>And dare you hope for compassion;
you who had no compassion on your
own mother, for whom you ought to
have worked as your brother did. He
is, in my esteem, no better than a monster
in nature, who forgets to honour
and love his parents. Of what do you
complain? Do you not know that the
Supreme Being sends down his judgments
upon such children as you are?
Did your mother nourish you in your
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>youth, and preserve you from all harm,
to be abused by you when she was grown
old, and to see you give yourself up entirely
to idleness, and from idleness to
vice? You are fallen into beggary, take
care or something worse may follow.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div>EDWARD.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Go your way, all faults may be forgiven
but those of an ungrateful son.
He who could treat his parents with
cruelty, must have a very depraved heart,
and deserves nothing but cruelty from
others.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div>ENGLISHMAN.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>If you knew what I have suffered from
sickness and want, and how sincerely I
repent, I think that you would still pity
me.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>What do you now resolve to do?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>ENGLISHMAN.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>If I could get a little money to buy
myself a coat, I would endeavour to
work my passage to London and seek
for my brother.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>You would go and live an idle life at
his expence, but you will never more
be a burthen to him; your worthy brother
lived with my father, and died a
few months ago in my arms.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div>ENGLISHMAN.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Then, indeed, I have lost my only
friend.—(And he bursted into tears.)</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div>CHARLES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>No, as I respect your worthy brother’s
memory, I will give you an old coat of
mine and some necessaries, and procure
you a passage on board the packet we are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>to sail in to-morrow or next day, but
only on condition that you will promise
to go to sea when I procure you a
birth; I will not bring a beggar back
to my native country.</p>

<p class='c007'>Your brother then gave him some
money to provide himself with a dinner,
for he looked half famished.</p>

<p class='c007'>This is the last letter I shall have the
pleasure to write to you from Holland;
I wish we had already set sail, I feel
quite low spirited at being obliged to
take leave of so many friends and acquaintance.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Landbergen has just left us with
tears in his eyes, and we have renewed
our promise of corresponding with his
son; nay, your brother said it was possible
he might again see him, for that he
was so pleased with his journey to Holland,
it was probable, if his father made
no objection, that he and I should,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>some future time, pay them a longer
visit. He said so, I believe, to comfort
me as well as Mr. Landbergen. In
a few days I hope in person to assure
you that I am your sincere friend, till
then do not forget</p>

</div>

<p class='c007'>P. S. I must tell you that Charles
received a letter from Lady Grandison
this morning, with a bill enclosed in it.
His eyes sparkled with pleasure, and soon
after he went out without asking me
to accompany him; but returned with
such a cheerful aspect, that I am sure
he went on some benevolent errand; I
suspect to the young French painter;
though I did not make any, even indirect
enquiries, for I think a friend should
not act like a spy, nor be impertinently
curious to try to discover what another
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>chuses to conceal.—If your brother
wishes to do good in secret, may he enjoy
the silent plaudits of his own heart.
I know already enough to make me
love him, and long to follow his example.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>LETTER XXXVI.<br> <span class='large'><span class='sc'>William</span> <i>to young</i> <span class='sc'>Mr. Van Landbergen</span>.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>I promised to inform you of our
safe arrival; well, here we are in London,
happy as our hearts could wish.
We were received in the most cordial
manner by all this dear worthy family,
and Sir Charles and Lady Grandison embraced
their son with fresh warmth,
when they saw the little cur we brought
with us: and he seemed delighted with
this fresh testimony of their affection.</p>

<p class='c007'>Our passage was very pleasant, and I
cannot forbear communicating to you
an instance of Charles’s considerate benevolence.
It is the business of a generous
soul to find every where opportunities
of doing good. Perhaps, yes, it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>appears very probable, that the Supreme
Being makes choice of those who endeavour
to please him, to distribute his
blessings through their hands. On the
contrary, in what a fearful state are those
who, by their vices, are separated from
God. I was struck with a remark
which Dr. Bartlett once made in my
presence, “Woe to those who by their
evil deeds, and the misery they bring
on others, seem to be His instruments of
punishment—how are they separated
from God and happiness!”</p>

<p class='c007'>When we went on board the packet
Charles particularly observed a man who
was obliged to be lifted on board, sickness
had so wasted his strength. The
poor man was very much emaciated,
and had a violent cough, which seemed
to shake his whole frame; yet he had
scarcely sufficient covering to shield him
from the cold, though it was piercing
weather, and his weak lungs evidently
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>could ill bear to be so roughly assaulted.</p>

<p class='c007'>Charles did not delay a moment to
enquire who he was and what ailed him.
He found that the poor man came to
Holland about business, and had been
detained by a fever much longer than he
expected; but that being a little better,
and finding himself just able to travel,
he was hastening back to his wife and
children.</p>

<p class='c007'>Charles soon contrived to get into
conversation with him, and observed
that he must suffer very severely from
the cold, for the poor wretch was afraid
to go down into the cabin, his breath
was so very short. I do suffer, replied
the invalid, but heaven will strengthen
me; I have already, during the course
of my life, been enabled to bear more
than I imagined I could ever have endured.—Charles
interrupted him, and
pulling off his great coat, said, see now
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>what heaven sends you. I am young
and in good health, and can bear cold
much better than you. The sick man
viewed him with astonishment. Edward,
who was at a little distance, ran
up and whispered Charles, what are
you going to fight? Yes, answered
Charles, a little disconcerted, I am going
to fight against the cold, to preserve
this poor man from it, who might,
perhaps, catch his death. He then
helped him to put it on, and hastily
left him, not only to avoid his thanks,
but to prevent any one else from observing
what he termed a common act
of humanity. Edward still went on,
extolling his benevolence; he stopped
him, saying—What have I done? Is it
such a great act of benevolence for one
who is in good health and strong, to
give his great coat to a poor sick man
benumbed with cold? One of the emperors
of China, when in the field of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>battle, gave his own fur cloak to one of
his officers, saying, when his nobles
seemed to wonder at it, that he wished
he was able to give a cloak to every one
of his soldiers. Should I, then, regard
myself more than a monarch who looks
upon himself as the ruler of the whole
earth, said he, laughing; and then began
to talk about something else.</p>

<p class='c007'>Charles and Edward are gone out a
riding, and I staid at home to write to
you.</p>

<p class='c007'>They are come home, I hear Charles
singing as he walks along the passage—he
has charming spirits.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div>IN CONTINUATION.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Charles entered my room;—You are
writing to Mr. Landbergen, I suppose,
said he, will you give me leave to add a
few words; but fold up your letter,
for I do not want to see what you have
written; letters are sacred even as our
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>thoughts, and a friend should not take
advantage of the confidence reposed in
him. Dr. Bartlett has often cautioned
me always to keep up a little ceremony
with a friend, and repeated the old proverb,
that too much familiarity breeds
contempt. I have scarcely left him
room to write a line. Adieu,</p>

<p class='c007'>P. S. I have only just room to tell
you that we are all well and happy. I
will soon write you a long letter, in the
mean time present my respects to your
father, and believe me to be your affectionate
friend</p>

</div>

<p class='c006'>Permit me, dear Sir, to beg your
advice respecting a plan which gratitude
and duty have suggested to me. I earnestly
long to make some amends for
my past behaviour, and convince my
father that I have now a just sense of his
goodness. I contracted many debts, the
discharge of which involved him in
difficulties; I have now determined
to save a part of my income, and
have reason to think I shall soon be advanced
on account of my diligence.
You know that for some years he has
been obliged, as the only means to support
himself, to attend some young gentlemen
as a private tutor. Indeed he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>made himself a slave to it in order to
support me in my extravagance, and,
instead of banishing me from his house
and heart, as I deserved, he received me
with open arms, when I returned, and
said, Blessed be heaven, I have again
found my son! As his health begins to
break, I wish to persuade him to give
up his long troublesome walks; and I
am sure that in a short time I shall be
able to maintain both him and myself
very genteely.</p>

<p class='c007'>I have now to mention another circumstance
to you since you led me to see
the charms of virtue, and experience
its heart-felt pleasures. I have been attached
to a very amiable young woman,
who has a small fortune, and I should
not hesitate a moment about marrying
her, only I am afraid to entangle myself
with a family before I have provided
for my father. Added to this, one of
my relations has proposed to me to marry
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>an old widow who is very rich, and
he assures me I should not be rejected,
if I offered her my hand. After what
I have told you, you may suppose I feel
no great affection for her. Yet, I sometimes
think, I ought this way to provide
for a parent I have so grossly injured.
I know not what to determine
on; pray write to me soon, and give
me your opinion without any reserve,
by so doing you will add to the obligation
already conferred on your sincere
friend</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>LETTER XXXVIII.<br> <span class='large'><span class='sc'>Charles</span> <i>to</i> <span class='sc'>Landbergen</span>.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>With what pleasure did I read over
your letter! how happy am I to find
that you have such a just sense of your
duty! I agree with you that an old
man, whose health has been injured by
cares and sorrows, ought not to work
for his bread, when he has young and
healthy children. Allow him as much
of your salary as you can spare; it is
the first debt you ought to pay. You
may, by this means, be obliged to deny
yourself some superfluities, and even
what the world calls necessaries, but
how richly will you be repaid for this
self-denial! However since you have confided
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>in me, let me take the liberty to
suggest to you, that you must never recede
from an engagement deliberately
entered into with a father. Weigh this
matter well in your mind, and consider
that no marriage contract will release you
from this prior one; and if, after mature
deliberation, you find that you have sufficient
resolution to fulfil what you intend
to promise, give way to that laudable ardour,
which your love and gratitude for
your father inspires. If not, permit
him, as long as heaven grants him
strength, to follow his present employment,
and allow him as much as you
can spare to lighten his cares, without
making any formal promise.</p>

<p class='c007'>As to your marrying one woman
while you love another, it appears to
me the most shocking breach of duty;
and we are not to fulfil one duty by
sacrificing another. I must own I do
not think you can have any great chance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>for happiness (supposing your affections
were not engaged) with a woman old
enough to be your mother. No, do
not marry the widow! Have a little
patience, and in a year or two you may
be able to offer your hand to the girl
your heart has chosen, and your father
may be happy in the bosom of your family.
Do you think that he could be
happy if your peace was sacrificed to
procure him a few of the conveniences
of life? You know little of him, if you
think so; he would be doubly distressed
if he saw you unhappy. Believe me, a
father like yours can only find his happiness
in the happiness of his child; open
your heart to him, and never think of marrying
without his approbation. For my
part, I hope never to enter into the marriage
state without having my choice
confirmed by the consent of my parents,
who, I am sure, will never persuade me to
marry merely from pecuniary motives.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>I have heard my father say, that a child
should always choose the person he is to
be united to; but a parent who has
acted like a friend by giving his children
a good education, ought always to have
a negative voice. I shall make no apology
for having complied with your request:
try what has flowed from the
sincerity of my heart by the test of a
wiser judgment, and believe me to be
sincerely your friend,</p>

</div>

<p class='c006'>Next week we are to leave this
house, and the very thought of it makes
me sad; but our future residence is so
near that I can have a daily intercourse
with my valuable friends. Charles and
I shall exercise ourselves together in the
arts and sciences, and I shall receive the
benefit of all his masters: it will then
be my own fault if I do not acquire
knowledge. I shall write to you often,
my dear Landbergen, and you, I hope,
will answer my letters. But let me
now tell you, that Sir Charles is so
pleased with your filial piety, that he is
determined to use all his interest to obtain
your father a sinecure place in Holland,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>that you may be enabled to marry
sooner than you expected. I am certain
he will do something for you; you will
then have various other duties to fulfil.
What a pleasure it will be to us to see you
happy and respectable, when we again
visit my dear native country! But I
have something to tell you of the amiable
Emilia. A young gentlewoman in
distress was lately in her service, whose
mother has been long afflicted with a
lingering disorder. Emilia, the noble
Emilia, has prevailed on her mother to
let her wait on herself, and give the
poor widow, by way of an annuity, the
wages she must have given her daughter,
had she remained with her as a
servant.</p>

<p class='c007'>Farewell, my dear Sir, present my
respects to your worthy father, and assure
all my Dutch friends that the distance
which separates me from them
and my country, will never make me
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>forget them. Sir Charles has sent
Harry’s brother to the farm at Grandison Hall.
He has behaved so well since
his arrival in England, that we have
some reason to look upon him as a sincere
penitent.</p>

those virtues which so eminently distinguished
him and his father; and in the
course of time he had the pleasure of
calling his friend William brother.</p>

<p class='c007'>May these examples excite an emulation
in the minds of my young readers.
May they read with attention the precepts
these volumes contain, always remembering

that he who loves God will also love his
